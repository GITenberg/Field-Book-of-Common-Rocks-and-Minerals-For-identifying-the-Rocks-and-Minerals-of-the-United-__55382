<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>Everyone, who is alert as he wanders about
this world, wants to know what he is seeing
and what it is all about. Here and there with
the aid of capable guides a few have been introduced
into the sphere of that wide and fascinating
knowledge of Nature which has been so rapidly
accumulated during this and the latter part of
the last century. It is a full treasure house
constantly being enriched, but unfortunately the
few who have been initiated have soon acquired
a technical language and habit, so that their
knowledge and new acquisitions are communicated
to but few. The public at large, not having
the language nor an interpreter at hand, has
come almost at once to a barrier which few have
the time or patience to surmount.</p>
<p>Latterly it has become clear that the largest
progress cannot be made if the knowledge of
any branch of Science is confined to a few only.
The most rapid advances have been made where
many men are interested and enthusiastic. In
no science should there be a difficult barrier
between the amateur and the professional student.
All Nature is equally open for everyone
to study, and there should never be created obstacles
as by the use of terminology not easily
acquired by anyone. Of late these barriers have
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
been in part broken down and competent students
have written guides which anyone can
follow, and soon begin to know the plants, trees,
birds, insects, etc. So far no one has attempted
to make the study of minerals and rocks so direct
and simple that everyone can get a start. Most
books on minerals, and practically all those on
rocks are written for school courses, and to say
the least chill any enthusiasm which is naturally
aroused by the finding of interesting looking
rocks or minerals.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is first of all to provide
a means of identifying minerals and rocks by
such methods as are practical without elaborate
equipment or previous training: and second to
suggest the conditions under which the various
minerals and rocks were formed, so that, at the
first contact, one may get a conception of the
events which have anteceded the mineral or
rock which has been found. For this purpose
keys have been worked out for determining the
rocks and minerals by such obvious features as
color, hardness, etc. Each mineral or rock is
introduced by a summary of its characters, then
the features by which it may be distinguished
from any other similar mineral are given, after
which its mode of origin and its meanings are
considered. For those interested in the composition
of the minerals, it is given in chemical
symbols with each mineral. Most classifications
of minerals are based on the composition, all the
sulphides, carbonates, etc., being grouped together,
but in this book, because the popular
interest and commercial uses are primarily in
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
the metal present, the minerals are grouped in
each case about the chief metal, all the minerals
of iron being grouped together, for instance.</p>
<p>A few minerals and rocks which are not strictly
common have been included such as gems and
meteorites; the gems because they are of intense
interest to their owners and are often simply
perfect examples of a fairly common mineral;
and such forms as meteorites because it is important
that, if one should run across one, it should
be recognized, and so not lost to the world.</p>
<p>The book is freely illustrated, those minerals
in which color is important for identification
being illustrated in colors, and those which are
black, or in which the color is not a determining
factor, are shown in either photographic or
outline figures.</p>
<p>In the introductory chapter there are explanations
of the terms used in describing minerals,
and of the systems in which they are grouped.
A knowledge of the systems may not be a
necessity, but it is a great help in determining
minerals, and is very important in understanding
why the individual minerals take the varied
forms which are characteristic of them. These
systems will be better understood after a few
minerals have been gathered and examined.</p>
<p>It is hoped the book will help those who have
already some knowledge of rocks and minerals,
and especially that it will tempt many to begin
an acquaintance with the rocks and minerals
which are all about them, and are the foundation
on which our material progress is built. Rocks
and minerals have some advantages over most
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
objects which are collected in that they neither
require special preparation before they can be
kept, nor do they deteriorate with time.</p>
<p>The author will appreciate corrections or
suggestions as to better presentation of the
material in this book.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">AN INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Why should one be interested in
rocks and minerals? Because the
whole world is made of rocks and minerals.
They are the foundations on which we build.
From them we draw all our metals, and the
extent to which we utilize our minerals is a
measure of the advance of our civilization. Fragments
of rock are the soil from which, by way
of the plants, we draw our food, and ultimately
our life. The rocks make wild or gentle scenery,
one at least of the sources of pleasure. Knowledge
of rocks and minerals is then knowledge of
fundamentals, of ultimate sources. Between
finding the raw materials and their present uses
there are usually many steps (so many that we
forget that the beginning and end are united),
as for instance in your watch. It is made of gold,
brass, steel, agate, glass, and perhaps has luminous
radium paint on the hands. It is a long way
from finding and mining gold, chalcopyrite,
hematite, carnotite, etc., through the raw materials,
gold, copper, iron, etc., to the finished
watch, but the minerals are the foundations of
the watch; and it took centuries to find them and
learn one by one how to use them, from the gold
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
10,000 years ago down to the radium within the
last fifty years. Then too there is joy in going
out into Nature&rsquo;s wild and raw places, joy in
being on the foundations of the earth, joy in the
scenery, in the beauty of the minerals themselves.</p>
<p>But why collect the rocks and minerals? First
because this is the way to know them. Both
mineral and rocks require careful examination
in order to see all those fine points by which they
are distinguished. It is often necessary to
compare one with another to get in mind the
differences of form, color, streak, though with
increasing familiarity these characteristics are
recognized at first sight. It is the repeated
examination which makes a rock tell the story
of the country from which it came. Our first
attempts to read the story give us only the most
general facts. Nature&rsquo;s book, written in the
rocks, has to be read closely, often between the
lines. Until we are used to the characters in
which the words are written, we read slowly.
When they look at Nature&rsquo;s book, always open,
most people do not read; for they do not know
their letters. Every mineral is a letter, every
rock a word, and we learn to read as we learn the
minerals and rocks, and every time we go over
them we get more facts coming out. The place
where a rock or mineral occurs is of course the
relation between them, and is involved in reading
the story. No one today is a perfect reader.
We are all learning to see more in the rocks day
by day. So it is important to have the rocks
and minerals where they can be handled and
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
repeatedly examined, where we can turn to them
in our leisure moments. Don&rsquo;t stop when you
have learned the name of a mineral or rock.
You need more. See what it means. Secondly,
minerals have beauties of form, color, and structure,
and they do not fade. They will be as
perfect in ten years as when found. We are all
naturally crows, and love to gather the objects
which interest us. It is not a bad habit, and only
needs directing. Cultivate it. Have a hobby,
and minerals and rocks are a good one; for they
are like treasures in Heaven which &ldquo;neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt.&rdquo; Not only will they give
you pleasure, but they will be a constructive
education, training the eye to see, and the mind
to think straight. No one ever regretted the
time and effort spent in collecting either minerals
or rocks.</p>
<h3>Collecting</h3>
<p>In order to make a collection valuable
two or three rules must be observed.
In the case of rocks, collect large enough
samples so that they will be characteristic, and
clear in their make-up. The standard size for
rocks is 3 &times; 4 inches on top and one to two inches
thick according to the nature of the rock. Tiny
fragments do not give the character of the rock
as well, and they are all the time getting into
confusion. <b>Every specimen should be labeled</b>,
with at least its name and the exact locality from
which it came. Composition, structural features,
associations, and classification may be added, the
more the better; for each item adds to the information
and interest of the specimen. One may
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
make his own labels or have printed blanks,
and may put as much care and art into the
labels as desired, the more the better. One thing
is very important and that is to have a number
on the label with a corresponding one on the
specimen, so that in case they should get separated,
they may be readily brought together,
even by one who is not familiar with the individual
specimens. Lastly, give your collection
as good a place as possible, either in drawers,
boxes or in a case. The specimens are worth
being kept in order and where they can be readily
seen and compared. Nature is systematic, and
there is a reason for the order in which rocks and
minerals are taken up. It is desirable either that
this order, or some one of the orders of Nature
appear in the collection. In this book the metals
are the basis of classification, all those minerals
primarily related to one of the metals being
grouped together.</p>
<p>In collecting minerals, the size of the specimens
can not be so regularly followed, but it
should be followed when collecting non-crystalline
minerals, and when possible. Crystals
however are chosen from a variety of points of
view, as perfection of form, color, examples of
cleavage, twinning, etc.; so that in many cases
smaller or larger examples must appear in the
collection. It is always desirable that as many
variations of a rock or mineral as possible should
appear in the collection, and in many cases
examples of the matrix from which the crystals
came. When crystals are tiny, it is well to place
them in vials, that they may not be lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3>Where</h3>
<p>Where shall we start in making a
collection? Near home. Get the
local minerals and rocks first, and then range as
widely as possible. The best places are bare and
exposed rocks, especially where fresh and un-weathered
surfaces are available. Quarries and
where there has been blasting along roads offer
fine opportunities. Fissures and cavities in the
rocks are especially likely to have fine crystals,
and in all localities continued search will reveal
a surprising number of different minerals. The
greatest variety occur in metamorphic rocks, or
where igneous rocks come in contact with other
rocks, but even the sedimentary rocks have a
goodly range of minerals. All through the
glaciated regions of the northern United States
lie scattered boulders brought from afar, which
will yield a surprising number of minerals and
variety of rocks.</p>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>One may start with a very simple
equipment, a geologist&rsquo;s or stone
mason&rsquo;s hammer which can be obtained at any
hardware store, being sufficient for field work.
Rocks should be broken, so as to show fresh
surfaces and to get below the disintegrating
effects of weathering. At home one should have
a streak plate (a piece of unglazed porcelain), a
set of hardness minerals (see <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>), and a
small bottle each of hydrochloric and nitric acid.
A pocket lens is useful in order to see more clearly
the form of small minerals. These things can be
purchased of any Naturalist&rsquo;s Supply Co., like
Ward&rsquo;s Natural Science Establishment, P.O. 24,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Beachwood Sta., Rochester, N. Y., or the Kny-Scheerer
Corp., 483 First Ave., New York City.
Success depends upon a quick eye, and persistent
hunting. When traveling, opportunities
are offered at frequent intervals to see and get
new specimens.</p>
<h3>Study Your Collection</h3>
<p>Be sure and see the meaning in
each rock and mineral. The history
of the country is revealed in its
rocks and minerals. Note whether the rocks are
horizontal or folded, whether they change character
from place to place, or vertically. In going
over a piece of country you may locate an ancient
mountain system now leveled, by noting a
series of metamorphic rocks, with a central core
of granite, the roots of former mountains. Don&rsquo;t
be afraid to draw conclusions from what you see.
Later, when the opportunity offers, look up the
region in the geological folio, bulletin, or map of
that section, and check up your findings. These
geological folios and bulletins, of which there is
one for nearly every region, are a great help to
collectors in suggesting where to look for various
rocks and minerals. Write to the Director of
the U. S. Geological Survey, Washington, D. C.,
for a catalogue of the publications of the United
States Survey, or find out from him what are the
maps or folios for the region in which you are
interested. These U. S. publications cost but
little. When opportunity presents itself, visit
other collections. In them you will see some of
the minerals or rocks which have puzzled you,
and there is nothing quite so satisfactory as
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
seeing the rocks or minerals themselves. No
description can always be so convincing. Then
too you will get suggestions as to localities that
you can visit.</p>
<h3>Literature</h3>
<p>As your collection grows, if you

<br /><span class="h2line2">ON THE FORMS AND PROPERTIES OF MINERALS</span></h2>
<h3>Rocks</h3>
<p>All we know of the earth by direct
observation is confined to less than
four miles depth; though by projecting downward
the layers of rock that come to the surface, we
may fairly assume a knowledge of the structure
down to six or eight miles depth. This outer
portion is often referred to as the &ldquo;crust of the
earth,&rdquo; but the idea that the deeper portions are
molten is no longer held. This outer portion is
made of rocks, and a rock may be defined as, <i>a
mass of material, loose or solid, which makes up an
integral part of the earth</i>, as granite, limestone, or
sand. The rocks (except glassy igneous ones)
are aggregates of one or more minerals; either in
their original form like the quartz, feldspar and
mica of granite, or in a secondary grouping,
resulting from the units having been dislodged
from their primary position and regrouped a
second time, as in sandstone or clay.</p>
<h3>Minerals</h3>
<p>Since the rocks are aggregates of
minerals, it is best to take up the
minerals first. A mineral may be defined as <i>a
natural inorganic substance of definite chemical
composition</i>. It is usually solid, generally has
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
crystalline structure, and may or may not be
bounded by crystal faces. <i>A crystal is a mineral,
bounded by symmetrically grouped faces, which
have definite relationships to a set of imaginary
lines called axes.</i> There are between 1100 and
1200 minerals, of which 30 are so frequently
present, and so dominant in making up the rocks,
that they are termed <i>rock-forming minerals</i>.
About 150 more occur frequently enough so that
they can be termed common minerals, and one
may expect to find a fairly large proportion of
them. Some of these are abundant in one part
of the country and rare in others, but this book is
written to cover the United States, and so all
those which have a fair abundance are included,
though some will only be found in the west and
others mostly in the east. Then there are some
more minerals which are really rare, but which
are cherished because of their beauty of color,
and are used as gems. These are mentioned, and
many of the gems are simply clear and beautiful
examples of minerals, which in dark or cloudy
forms are much more common. If one finds any
of these rare minerals which are not mentioned
in this book, he must turn to one of the larger
mineralogies mentioned in the literature list to
determine them.</p>
<h3>Crystal Structure</h3>
<p>A crystal is a mass of molecules,
all of the same composition. A molecule
in its turn is made up of atoms,
and each atom is a unit mass of an element.
Thus the calcite molecule is made up of one
unit or atom of calcium, one of carbon, and three
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
of oxygen (CaCO&#8323;). These atoms are held together
by an attraction, and make a molecule,
and for the study of minerals the molecule is the
unit. The mineral, calcite, is a mass of molecules
all like the one above, and each molecule
so small as to be invisible even with the aid of the
most powerful microscope. When calcite is in
crystal form, the molecules, like ranks of soldiers,
are arranged each in its place, each at a definite
distance from the other. While each molecule
may vibrate or wiggle within certain limits it
does not leave its place. (The comparison with
soldiers is a good one for the molecules of one
layer, but it must be remembered that in a
crystal there are also like spacings and ranks up
and down as well.) As long as the molecules
remain in fixed ranks, up and down, forward and
back, and sideways, the crystal is perfect. Calcite
may be heated until it melts and becomes
liquid. Then the molecules leave their definite
arrangement and move about in all sorts of directions,
like the soldiers after ranks have broken.
So long as the molecules are thus free to move
about but keep together, the substance is a
liquid. There are cases when the molecules in
this disorder take fixed positions without falling
into ranks. Such minerals are non-crystalline
and usually appear glassy. If still greater heat
is applied to the mineral in liquid form, a point
is reached (the vapor point), above which the
molecules go flying away from each (like soldiers
in a panic), each seeking to get as far from the
other as possible, so only a container will prevent
their dissipation. When in this condition a
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
mineral is gaseous. When cooled, the reverse
order obtains. The molecules of gas gather into
a miscellaneous mob or liquid: and if this is
further cooled (but not too suddenly), they fall
into ranks and make a crystal. This may be
illustrated with water. When above 212&deg; F. it is
steam (molecules wildly dissipated); when between
212&deg; and 32&deg; it is water (molecules close
to each other, but milling like a herd of cattle);
and when below 32&deg; it is ice, the molecules ranged
in perfect order, rank on rank.</p>
<h3>Crystal Systems</h3>
<p>With all the possible forms that
crystals can and do take, there are
six systems of arrangement. First
there is the case where ranks, files, and vertical
rows are all equal, and now to be scientific, instead
of talking about ranks, files, etc., we use
the term axes to express these ideas; the files or
arrangements from front to back, being called
the <i>a axis</i>, the ranks, or side to side arrangement
the <i>b axis</i>, and the vertical arrangement
the <i>c axis</i>. (See <a href="#Plate_1">Plate 1</a>.) These axes are imaginary
lines, but they represent real forces.</p>
<h3>Isometric system</h3>
<p>When the axes are all equal and
at right angles to each other, a
crystal is said to be in the <b>isometric
system</b>. The cube is the basal form
and each side is known as a face. The ends
of the axes come to the middle of the cube
faces. The essential feature of this system is
that whatever happens to one axis must happen
to all, which is another way of saying that all
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
the axes are equal. If we think of the cube as
having the corners cut off, we would have a new
face on each of the eight corners, in addition
to the six cube faces. Then if each of these
new faces were enlarged until they met and
obliterated the cube faces, an eight-sided figure,
the octahedron, would result. In this the axes
would ran to the corners. Another modification
of the cube would be to bevel each of its twelve
edges, making twelve new faces in addition to
the six cube faces. If we think of these new
faces being developed until they meet and
obliterate the cube faces, there will result a
twelve-sided figure, the dodecahedron. And
the 24 edges of the dodecahedron could be
beveled to make a 24-sided figure, and so on.
Of course in Nature the corners are not cut, nor
the edges beveled, but as a result of the interaction
of the forces expressed by the axes and
the distribution of the molecules, the molecules
arrange themselves in a cube, octahedron, dodecahedron
or combination of these basal forms.</p>
<h3>Crystal formation</h3>
<p>Crystals are formed in liquids as
they cool or evaporate and can no
longer hold the minerals in solution.
Crystals start about a center or nucleus, and
molecule by molecule, the orderly arrangement
is increased and the crystal grows, there being
no size which is characteristic. If free in the
liquid the crystal grows perfectly on all sides, but
if crystals are growing side by side, there comes a
time when they interfere with each other. Then
the free faces continue to grow and the orderly
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
internal arrangement is maintained, though
externally there is interference.</p>
<h3>Tetragonal system</h3>
<p>In the second or <b>tetragonal system</b>
one axis (the c axis) is different from
the other two, but all three are still
at right angles with each other. This is saying
scientifically that the lines of force are greater
or less in one direction than in the other two, but
they act at right angles to each other. The a
and the b axes are equal and anything that
happens to one of these two must happen to the
other, but need not happen to the c axis. Thinking
of the molecules that arrange themselves
under this system of forces, it is clear that the
simplest form will be a square prism, <i>i.e.</i>, front
to back, and from side to side the numbers of
molecules will be equal, but up and down there
will be a greater or lesser number. If the eight
corners of this prism were cut, and these corner
faces increased in size until they met, the resulting
octahedron would be longer (or shorter) from
top to bottom than from side to side or front to
back, but the measurement from front to back
would be equal to the one from side to side. In
this system we may have the vertical edges of the
prism beveled, and not have to bevel the horizontal
ones, or we may bevel the horizontal edges
and not the vertical ones. There is no dodecahedron
in this system or in any other system
than the isometric. The forms in this tetrahedral
system are really a combination of the four
sides of the square prism with such modifications
as equally affect them all, with two ends which
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
may be flat, or pyramidal, or modified pyramidal
faces.</p>
<h3>Orthorhombic system</h3>
<p>The third system has all three axes
unequal, but all three are still at
right angles with each other. This
is saying that the lines of force in the crystals
are all at right angles to each other but of unequal
value. The faces in this case are all in
pairs. What happens at one end of an axis
must happen at the opposite end, but does not
need to happen at the ends of any of the other
axes. We are dealing with pairs of faces (one
at either end of an axis), and if three such
pairs are combined in the simplest manner, the
resulting figure will be a rectangular prism. If
we cut the eight corners of this prism and enlarge
the faces until they meet, the result is
an octahedron, in which the distance from top
to bottom, from side to side, or from front to
back is not the same in any two cases. (See
<a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a>.) In this system if a face is made by
beveling one edge of the prism there must be a
corresponding face on the edge diagonally
opposite, but there does not have to be one on
any of the other edges. However if a corner is
cut, that face affects all the axes and so all the
corners must be cut. A great many crystals
occur in this system, and some of them which
are prismatic in shape may give trouble, for it is
not uncommon for the vertical edges of the prism
to be so beveled, that two of the original prism
faces are obliterated, and the two remaining faces
added to the four new faces make a six-sided
prism, which at first glance seems to belong to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
hexagonal system. (See <a href="#Plate_3">Plate 3</a>, fig. 3.) Close
examination however will show that, instead of
all the prism faces being alike, as would be
necessary for the hexagonal system, they are
really in pairs, and one pair at least will be
distinguished in some way, such as being striated,
pitted, or duller.</p>
<h3>Monoclinic system</h3>
<p>The fourth system has all the axes
unequal, the a axis and the b axis
at right angles to each other, but
the c axis is inclined to the a axis, meeting it
at some other than a right angle. The <b>monoclinic
system</b> is like the orthorhombic system
except that it leans, or is askew, in one direction.
The result is that the faces at the ends
of the b axis are rhombohedral, while the others
are rectangular. As in the foregoing system,
the faces are in pairs at opposite ends of the
axes; and as in the orthorhombic system, a
face may occur on one edge and only have to
be repeated on the edge diagonally opposite.
The simplest form in this system will be made
by combining the three pairs of faces at the
opposite ends of the axes, which gives a prism,
which is rectangular in cross section, but leans
backward (or forward) if placed on end. As
in all the systems, if a corner is cut, all must
be cut; and if these corner faces are extended
to meet each other, an octahedron results, in
which, as in the prism, no two axes are equal.
If this octahedron is properly orientated (<i>i.e.</i>
with the a and b axes horizontal), it will lean
forward or backward. Many minerals belong to
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
this system; and, as in the orthorhombic system,
it is not uncommon to have the vertical edges so
beveled that two of the prism faces are obliterated,
and the remaining two prism faces with
the four new faces make a six-sided prism, which
seems hexagonal. (See <a href="#Plate_3">plate 3</a>, figure 3.) However,
such a pseudo-hexagonal prism may be
recognized by at least one pair of the faces having
distinguishing marks (stri&aelig;, pits, or dullness),
instead of all being just alike.</p>
<h3>Triclinic system</h3>
<p>The fifth or <b>triclinic system</b> has
all the axes unequal, and no two of
them intersect at right angles. As
in the two preceding systems the faces occur
in pairs at the opposite ends of the axes. This
is the most difficult system in which to orientate
a crystal, but fortunately only a few crystals
occur in this system, such as the feldspars.</p>
<h3>Hexagonal system</h3>
<p>Lastly there is a group of crystals
which have four axes, one vertical,
and three in the horizontal plane
which intersect each other at angles of 60&deg;,
all these three being equal to each other, but
different from the vertical axis. The simplest
form in this system is the six-sided prism. If
one corner of this prism is cut all must be,
and if these corner faces are extended to meet
each other, a double-six-sided pyramid results.
In this system if one of the vertical edges of
the prism is beveled, all must be, but the horizontal
edges need not be; or the horizontal edges
may be beveled and the vertical ones not. The
ends as they are related to the c axis may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
developed independently of the prism, and so
the prism may be simply truncated by a flat end,
or have pyramids on either end.</p>
<h3>Hemihedral forms</h3>
<p>In this system it is quite common
to have forms which result from the
development of each alternate face of
either the prism or the double pyramid. In the
case of the prism, if every alternate face is developed
(and the others omitted) a three-sided
prism results, as in tourmaline. In the case of
the double pyramid if the three alternate faces
above are united with the three alternate faces
below, a six-sided figure is formed, which is
known as the rhombohedron, as all the faces are
rhombohedral in out-line and all equal. These
forms in which only half the faces are developed
are known as <b>hemihedral forms</b>. The same sort
of thing may happen in the isometric system in
the case of the octahedron, and also in the case
of the octahedron of other systems. When half
the faces of the octahedron are developed, two
above unite with two below and make a four-sided
figure, known as a tetrahedron. (See <a href="#Plate_10">plate 10</a>.)
While tetrahedrons may occur in any of
the first five systems they are not common outside
the isometric system.</p>
<h3>Twinning</h3>
<p>Another modification of the simple
forms which will be met occasionally
is <b>twinning</b>. By this is meant two crystals
growing together as though placed side by side
on some one of the faces, and then revolved until
the two axes which would normally be parallel
are at some definite angle with each other, 60&deg;, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
180&deg; which is commoner. The surface of contact
between the two crystals is called the <i>composition
face</i>, and as no more material can be added on
that face the crystals continue to grow developing
the other faces, and we find faces in contact
with each other which should be at the opposite
end or other side of the crystals. This contact of
faces which should not come in contact, and the
presence of reentrant angles are indications of
twinning. In some minerals the twinning may
be repeated time and again, and if the twinning
is on one of the end faces a branching structure
results, as in frost and snow crystals, or the
multiple twinning may be of crystals growing
side by side when the final form will approximate
a series of thin sheets placed side by side as in
some feldspars. The peculiar forms characteristic
of individual minerals are taken up under
the respective minerals.</p>
<p>Other important properties of minerals are
hardness, cleavage, specific gravity, streak, luster,
and color.</p>
<h3>Hardness</h3>
<p><b>Hardness</b> may be defined as the
mineral&rsquo;s resistance to abrasion or
scratching. It is measured by comparing a
mineral with Moh&rsquo;s scale, a set of ten minerals
arranged in the order of increasing hardness, as
follows:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1 <a href="#species_Talc">talc</a></dt>
<dt>2 <a href="#species_Gypsum">gypsum</a></dt>
<dt>3 <a href="#species_Calcite">calcite</a></dt>
<dt>4 <a href="#species_Fluorite">fluorite</a></dt>
<dt>5 <a href="#species_Apatite">apatite</a></dt>
<dt>6 <a href="#species_Feldspar">feldspar</a></dt>
<dt>7 <a href="#species_Quartz">quartz</a></dt>
<dt>8 <a href="#species_Topaz">topaz</a></dt>
<dt>9 <a href="#species_Corundum">corundum</a></dt>
<dt>10 <a href="#species_Diamond">diamond</a></dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>A set for measuring hardness may be purchased
from any dealer in mineral supplies. For rough
determination, as in the field, the following
objects have the hardness indicated; the finger
nail 2&frac14;, a penny 3, a knife blade about 5.5, and
glass not over 6. In testing, a mineral is harder
than the one it will scratch, and softer than the
one by which it is scratched. For instance, if a
mineral will scratch calcite and is scratched by
fluorite, it is between 3 and 4 in hardness, say
3.5. When two samples mutually scratch each
other they are of equal hardness. Care must be
used in determining hardness, especially with the
harder minerals; for often, when testing a mineral,
the softer one will leave a streak of powder
on the harder one, which is not a scratch. One
should always rub the mark to make sure it is
really a groove made by scratching.</p>
<h3>Cleavage</h3>
<p><b>Cleavage</b> is the tendency, characteristic
of most minerals, and due
to the arrangement of their molecules, to cleave
or break along definite planes. The cleavage of
any mineral is not irregular or indefinite, but
characteristic for each mineral, and always
parallel to possible or actual faces on the crystal,
and always so described. For instance galena
has three cleavages, all equally good, and
parallel to the cube faces; so it is said to have
cubic cleavage. In the same way fluorite has
octahedral cleavage, and calcite rhombic cleavage.
In some minerals cleavage is well developed
in one plane, and less developed in other
planes, or it may be lacking altogether. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
varying degrees of perfection by which a
mineral cleaves are expressed as, perfect
or imperfect, distinct or indistinct, good or
poor, etc.</p>
<h3>Specific gravity</h3>
<p>The <b>specific gravity</b> of a mineral
is its weight compared with the
weight of an equal volume of water,
and is therefore the expression of how many
times as heavy as water the mineral is. For
instance the specific gravity of pyrite is 5.1,
which is saying it is 5.1 times as heavy as
water. In a pure mineral the specific gravity
is constant, and an important factor in making
final determinations. As ordinarily obtained,
a piece of pure mineral is weighed in air,
which value may be called x. It is then immersed
in water and again weighed, and this
value is called y. The difference between the
weight in air and that in water is the weight
of an equal volume of water. Then we have
the following formula:</p>
<div class="center">specific gravity = <table class="inline"><tr><td>x</td></tr><tr><td class="ol">x-y</td></tr></table>.</div>
<p>Various balances have been devised for making
these measurements, but any balance which will
weigh small objects accurately, may be adapted
to specific gravity work, by hanging a small pan
under the regular weighing pan. When using
this balance, care is taken to see that the lower
pan is always submerged in water, even while
the mineral is being weighed in air, so that
when weighed in water in the lower pan,
the weight of this lower pan has already been
considered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h3>Streak</h3>
<p>By <b>streak</b> is meant the color of the
mineral when powdered. For some
minerals, especially metallic ores, it is of great
importance, for it remains constant, though the
color of the surface of the mineral changes
materially. It is most readily determined by
rubbing a corner of the mineral on a piece of
unglazed porcelain. Small plates, known as
&ldquo;streak plates&rdquo; are made for this purpose.</p>
<h3>Luster</h3>
<p>The <b>luster</b> of a mineral is the
appearance of its surface by reflected
light, and it is an important aid in determining
many minerals. Two types of luster are
recognized; metallic, the luster of metals, most
sulphides and some oxides, all of which are
opaque on their thin edges; and non-metallic,
the luster of minerals which are more or less
transparent on their thin edges, and most of
which are light colored. The common non-metallic
lusters are; vitreous, the luster of glass;
resinous, the appearance of resin; greasy,
oily appearance; pearly, the appearance of
mother-of-pearl; silky, like silk due to the
fibrous structure; adamantine, brilliant like a
diamond; and dull, as is chalk.</p>
<h3>Color</h3>
<p>When used with caution <b>color</b> is
of the utmost importance in determining
minerals, especially in making rapid
determinations. In metallic minerals it is constant
and dependable; but in the non-metallic
minerals it may vary, due to the presence of
small amounts of impurities which act as pigments.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Color depends on chemical composition,
and when not influenced by impurities is termed
<i>natural</i>; but when the color is due to some inclosed
impurity it is termed <i>exotic</i>. In this latter
case caution must be used in making determinations.
Many minerals are primarily colorless,
but take on exotic colors as a result of the
presence of small quantities of impurities; for
instance, pure corundum is colorless, but with a
trace of iron oxide present becomes red, and is
called the ruby, or with a trace of cobalt becomes
blue and is called sapphire.</p>

<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Gold Group</span></h3>
<p>Gold was undoubtedly the first metal to be
used by primitive man; for, occurring as it did
in the stream beds, its bright color quickly
attracted the eye, and it was so soft, that it was
easily worked into various shapes, which, because
they did not tarnish, became permanent ornaments.
The metal is associated with the very
earliest civilizations, being found in such ancient
tombs as those at Kertsch in Crimea and in
northern Africa and Asia Minor. It was used
in the cloisonn&eacute; work of Egypt 3000 years <span class="small">B.C.</span>
In America the Indians, especially to the south,
were using it long before the continent was
discovered.</p>
<p>Of all the metals gold is the most malleable,
and its ductility is remarkable, for a piece of a
grain&rsquo;s weight (less than the size of a pin head)
can be drawn out into a wire 500 feet long; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
it can be beaten into a thin leaf as thin as &sup1;/&#8322;&#8325;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320;
of an inch in thickness, and thus a bit, weighing
only a grain, can thus be spread over 56 square
inches.</p>
<p>It forms very few compounds, but has a
considerable tendency to make alloys (<i>i.e.</i>, mixtures
with other metals without the resulting
compound losing its metallic character). In
Nature gold is never entirely pure, but is an
alloy, usually with silver, there being from a
fraction of 1% up to 30% of the silver with the
gold, the more silver in the alloy, the paler the
color of the gold. Australian gold is the purest,
having but about .3% of silver in it, while
Californian gold has around 10% and Hungarian
gold runs as high as 30% of silver. Another
alloy fairly abundant in Nature is that with
tellurium, such as <i>calaverite</i> (AuTe&#8322;) which is a
pale brassy yellow, similar to pyrite, but with the
hardness of but 2.5. Another combination
includes gold, silver and tellurium, <i>sylvanite</i>,
(AuAgTe&#8324;) a silvery white mineral with a hardness
of but 2. Such combinations are known
as tellurides and the calaverite is mined as a source
of gold at Cripple Creek, Colo., while the sylvanite
is one of the important ores of gold in South
Africa. Occasionally gold is also found alloyed
with platinum, copper, iron, etc. Jewelers make
several alloys, &ldquo;red gold&rdquo; being 3 parts gold and
1 of copper, &ldquo;green gold&rdquo; being the same proportions
of gold and silver, and &ldquo;blue gold&rdquo;
being the combination of gold and iron. Our
gold coins are alloys, nine parts gold and one of
copper, to give them greater durability. Most of
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the gold recovered from nature is found native,
<i>i.e.</i>, the pure metal, or with some alloy.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Gold">Gold</a>
<br />Au
<br /><a href="#Plate_5">Pl. 5</a></h3>
<p>Usually non-crystalline, but occasionally
showing cube or octahedral
faces of the isometric system; hardness
2.5; specific gravity 19.3; color golden yellow;
luster metallic; opaque.</p>
<p>Gold is mostly found as the metal and is
readily recognized by its color, considerable
weight, hardness, malleability, and the fact that
it does not tarnish. It usually occurs in quartz
veins in fine to thick threads, scales or grains,
and occasionally in larger masses termed &ldquo;nuggets.&rdquo;
It is insoluble in most liquids so that
when weathered from its original sites, it was
often washed down into stream beds, to be found
later in the sands or gravels, or even in the sea
beaches. When thus found it is termed &ldquo;placer
gold,&rdquo; and its recovery is placer mining. Most
of the original discoveries of gold have been in
these placer deposits; and from them it has
been traced back to the ledges from which it
originally weathered. In the placer deposits the
size of the particles varies from fine &ldquo;dust&rdquo;
up to large nuggets, the largest found in California
weighing 161 pounds; but the largest one
found in the world was the &ldquo;Welcome Nugget,&rdquo;
found in Australia, and weighing 248 pounds.
When gold was discovered in California in 1848,
this became the chief source for the world, but
later this distinction went to Australia, and now
belongs to South Africa, which today yields over
half the annual supply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The ultimate source of gold is from the lighter
colored igneous rocks, like granites, syenites,
and diorites, throughout which it is diffused in
quantities too small to be either visible or worth
while to extract. It becomes available only
when it has been dissolved out by percolating
waters and segregated in fissures or veins, either
in or leading from these igneous rocks. Generally
this transfer of gold has taken place when
the rocks were at high temperatures, and by the
aid of water (and perhaps other solvents) which
was also at high temperatures. The presence
of gold in sandstones, limestones, etc., is secondary,
as is also its presence in sea water, in which
there is reported to be nearly a grain (about five
cents worth) in every ton of water. Beside the
direct recovery of gold from gold mining, a great
deal is obtained from its association with iron,
copper, silver, lead and zinc sulphides, in which
it is included in particles too fine to be visible,
but in quantities large enough to be separated
from the other metals after they are smelted.</p>
<p>In the United States gold is found in the
Cordilleran region from California to Alaska, in
Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, the Black
Hills of South Dakota, and in small quantities
in the metamorphosed slates of North and South
Carolina, Georgia, and in Nova Scotia.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Silver Group</span></h3>
<p>Though much commoner than gold, silver did
not attract the eye of man as early, probably
because it tarnishes when exposed to air or any
other agent having sulphur compounds in it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
and a black film of silver sulphide covers the
surface. Its first use was for ornaments, and
some of these found in the ruins of ancient Troy
indicate its use as early as 2500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> A thousand
years later it was being used to make basins,
vases and other vessels.</p>
<p>Silver is next to gold in malleability and
ductility, so that a grain of silver can be drawn
out into a wire 400 feet long, or beaten into
leaves &sup1;/&#8321;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320; of an inch in thickness. As a
conductor of electricity it is unsurpassed, being
rated at 100% while copper rates 93%. Silver
is also like gold in the freedom with which it
alloys with other metals, such as gold, copper,
iron, platinum, etc. All our silver coins, tableware,
etc., have some copper alloyed with the
silver to give it greater hardness and durability.</p>
<p>Unlike gold, silver freely enters into compounds
with the non-metals, which is the reason
that it is not found primarily in its native state,
but usually as a sulphide. Its ultimate source
is in the igneous rocks, few granites or lavas, on
analysis, failing to show at least traces of silver.
Before it is available as an ore, or mineral, it has
been dissolved from the original magma, and
segregated in fissures or veins, along with such
minerals, as quartz, fluorite, calcite, etc. This
seems to have taken place while the igneous
rocks were still hot, and by the agency of vapors
and liquids which were also hot. The presence
of silver in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks,
or even in sea water, is secondary.</p>
<p>The primary deposition of silver is usually in
the form of sulphides, the commoner of which
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
are, argentite or silver sulphide, pyrargyrite
or silver and antimony sulphide, and prousite, or
silver and arsenic sulphide. Its occurrence as
native silver, or the chloride, cerargyrite, is
secondary and due to the reactions which have
taken place when sulphide deposits have been
subjected to weathering agents.</p>
<p>The United States produces about 25% of the
world&rsquo;s supply, Mexico some 35%. It is especially
found along the Cordilleran ranges of both
North and South America.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Silver">Silver</a>
<br />Ag
<br /><a href="#Plate_6">Pl. 6</a></h3>
<p>Usually non-crystalline, but
occasionally showing cube or octahedron
faces of the isometric system;
hardness 2.5; specific gravity 10.5; color silvery
white; luster metallic; opaque.</p>
<p>When found in its native state silver is usually
in wirey, flakey, or mossy masses; but sometimes
masses of considerable size occur, the most
famous being an 800 pound nugget found in Peru,
and another of 500 pounds weight found at
Konsberg, Norway, and now preserved in Copenhagen.
When exposed to the air the surface
soon tarnishes and takes on a black color which
must be scraped off to see the real color.</p>
<p>Like gold, silver is usually found associated
with other metals, like iron, copper, lead and
zinc; and much of the silver recovered is obtained
in connection with the mining, especially
of copper and lead. Some lead ores have so
much silver in them that they are better worth
mining for the silver; galena, for instance, under
such circumstances being termed argentiferous
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
galena. Native silver is a secondary mineral,
having been formed by the reduction of some one
of its sulphides by water, carrying various elements
which had a greater affinity for the sulphur.</p>
<p>Silver is found along with copper in the Lake
Superior region, and in Idaho, Nevada, and
California.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Argentite">Argentite</a>

<br /><i>silver glance</i></h3>
<p>Usually in irregular masses, but
sometimes in cubes; hardness 2.5;
specific gravity 7.3; color and streak
lead gray; luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>Argentite, the simple sulphide of silver, is the
chief source from which silver is obtained. It
looks like galena, and has the same hardness,
streak and specific gravity, but can be distinguished
by the galena having a very perfect
cubic cleavage while the argentite has no cleavage.
Argentite is easily cut with a knife (sectile).
It is usually found in irregular masses, but sometimes
in cubes which make very choice cabinet
specimens; and is associated with such other
minerals as galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite,
pyrite, fluorite, quartz, and calcite.</p>
<p>It occurs in fissures and veins all through the
Cordilleran regions, especially in California,
Colorado, Nevada (Comstock Lode), Arizona
(Silver King Mine) and about the shores of
Lake Superior.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Pyrargyrite">Pyrargyrite</a>
<br />Ag&#8323;SbS&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_7">Pl. 7</a>
<br /><i>ruby silver</i> or <i>dark red silver</i></h3>
<p>Usually occurs in irregular masses;
hardness 2.5; specific gravity 5.8;
color dark red to black; streak purplish
red; luster metallic to adamantine;
translucent on thin edges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Pyrargyrite, the sulphide of silver and antimony,
is distinguished by its dark red color and
the purplish streak. It may look like prousite,
but is easily distinguished from the latter which
has a scarlet streak. It also at times looks like
hematite and cinnabar, but the hematite has a
hardness of 6, and the latter has the bright red
color throughout, while pyrargyrite turns black
when exposed to the light, so that the characteristic
red color will be seen only on fresh
surfaces. The characteristic red color can only
be kept on the mineral if it is constantly protected
from the light.</p>
<p>Sometimes pyrargyrite occurs in crystals and
these belong to the hexagonal system, and are
prisms with low faces on the ends, as on <a href="#Plate_7">plate 7</a>,
and the mineral is peculiar in that the faces on
the opposite ends are unlike.</p>
<p>Pyrargyrite is found mostly in fissures and
veins of quartz, fluorite, calcite, etc., and associated
with pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, etc.
It is fairly common in Colorado in Gunnison
and Ouray counties, in Nevada, New Mexico,
Arizona, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Prousite">Prousite</a>

<p>Usually occurs in irregular masses;
hardness 2.5; specific gravity 5.6;
color scarlet to vermilion; streak
the same; luster adamantine; transparent

<p>In general this mineral is very like pyrargyrite,
but has the scarlet color and streak which are
entirely characteristic. It is likely to have the
surface tarnished black, which happens on exposure
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
to light, so that it is essential to be sure
that fresh surfaces are being examined. Occasionally
it is found in crystals, of the same
type as the preceding mineral. It is generally
found associated with pyrargyrite.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Cerargyrite">Cerargyrite</a>
<br />AgCl
<br /><i>horn silver</i></h3>
<p>Usually found in irregular masses
or incrustations; hardness 1 to 1&frac12;;
specific gravity 5.5; color pearly gray,
grayish green to colorless, but turning violet
brown on exposure to light; luster resinous;
transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>This mineral is usually found in thin seams
or waxy incrustations, but it may occur in crystals
in which case they are cubes. It is very
soft and easily cut with a knife, which with its
tendency to turn violet-brown on exposure to
light, makes it easy to identify. Cerargyrite is a
secondary mineral, resulting from the action of
chlorine-bearing water on some one of the
sulphides of silver. It is found in the upper
portions of mines, especially those in arid regions.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Copper Group</span></h3>
<p>After gold the next metal to be utilized was
copper. About 4000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> our early forefathers
found that by heating certain rocks, they obtained
a metal which could be pounded, ground
and carved into useful shapes. Curiously enough
the rocks which had the copper also had some
tin in them, so that this first-found copper was
not pure, but had from five to ten per cent of tin
in it, making the resulting metal harder, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
what we call bronze. It was some thousands of
years later before they distinguished the copper
as a pure metal, but it worked and made good
tools. The newly found metal was not as ornamental
as gold; but, because it could be made
into tools, it had a tremendous influence on
man&rsquo;s development. As the bronze tools began
to take the place of the stone implements, the
&ldquo;Age of Bronze&rdquo; was ushered in. In America
the Indians in the Lake Superior region found
native copper weathered out of the rocks and
later mined it, and they too pounded it into
knives, axes, needles, and ornaments, but probably
never learned to melt it and mold their
tools. At any rate they were not as far advanced
in using this metal when Columbus
landed as were the southern Europeans 6500
years earlier. Since the use of iron became
general, copper has not held such a dominant
place, but it still is &ldquo;the red metal&rdquo; which holds
the second most important place.</p>
<p>It is malleable and ductile, though not equal
to gold or silver in these respects. It is a good
conductor of electricity and a very large amount
of copper is used in electrical manufacture,
roofing, wire, etc. It alloys with other metals;
ten parts copper and one of tin being bronze, ten
of copper and one of zinc is brass, and copper
with aluminum is aluminum bronze.</p>
<p>Like silver and gold, copper is widely diffused
through the igneous rocks, but before it is available,
it must be leached out by solvents and concentrated
in veins, fissures, or definite parts of
the lavas or granites. The primary ores are
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
those which, while the igneous rock was still
hot, were carried by hot vapors and liquids into
the fissures and there deposited, mostly as sulphides.
There is a long list of these, but in this
country, the following are the commoner ones;
chalcocite the sulphide of copper, chalcopyrite
the sulphide of copper and iron, bornite another
combination of copper, iron and sulphur, and
tetrahedrite copper and antimony sulphide.
When these primary ores are near enough to the
surface to come in contact with waters carrying
oxygen, carbon dioxide or silica in solution, they
may give up their sulphur and take some one of
these new elements and we have such forms as
cuprite, the oxide of copper, malachite and
azurite, carbonates of copper, or chrysocolla,
the silicate of copper. Native copper is also a
secondary deposit laid down in its present state
by a combination of circumstances which deprived
it of its original sulphur. In general
copper mining can not be profitably carried on
for ores with anything less than a half of one
percent in them; and the use of such low grade
ores has only been possible for a few years, as
the result of inventing most delicate processes
in the smelting.</p>
<p>The United States produces about a quarter of
the world&rsquo;s supply of copper, with Chile ranking
second with about 17%.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
and hardness, is generally found in irregular
grains, sheets, or masses, on which may sometimes
be detected traces of a cube or an octahedral
face, showing that it belongs to the
isometric system. The most famous locality is
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan which may be
taken as typical. Here, long before it was known
historically, the Indians found and dug out copper
to make knives, awls, and ornaments.</p>
<p>In this region, beds of lava alternate with
sandstones and conglomerates. The copper was
originally in the lavas, but has been dissolved
out, and now fills cracks and gas cavities in the
lavas, and also the spaces between the pebbles
of the conglomerate. This locality has been
very famous both because of the quantity mined,
and also because of the strikingly large masses
sometimes found. Today but little of the ore
runs above 2 percent copper, and it is mined
if it has as little as &frac12; of one percent.</p>
<p>While nowhere near as abundant, native
copper occurs in the same way in cavities and
cracks in the trap rocks of New Jersey, and along
the south shore of the Bay of Fundy. It is also
known from Oregon, the White River region of
Alaska, and in Arctic Canada.</p>

<br />CuFeS&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_8">Pl. 8</a>
<br /><i>copper pyrites</i> or <i>yellow copper ore</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals of irregular
masses; hardness 4; specific gravity
4.2; color bronze yellow; streak
greenish black; luster metallic;
opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>Chalcopyrite resembles pyrite, but
its color is a more golden yellow, and its surface
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
tarnishes with iridescent colors. Then too the
hardness of chalcopyrite is but 4 as compared
with 6 for pyrite. When in crystals this mineral
belongs to the tetrahedral system as the c axis
is but .985 in length as compared with I for the
two other axes. This difference is so little that,
to the eye, the octahedron appears to belong to
the isometric system. Chalcopyrite occurs in
octahedrons and tetrahedrons (as on <a href="#Plate_8">plate 8</a>),
the latter being the form where but half of
the octahedral faces are developed. However
by far the most frequent mode of occurrence
is in irregular masses.</p>
<p>This is the most important primary ore of
copper, and is widely distributed, being found
either in lavas, or in veins, or in fissures connected
with igneous rocks. Apparently the
deposits were made, either at the time of eruptive
disturbances or shortly afterward, from
vapors or hot solutions carrying the copper
sulphides (and other sulphides) from the molten
igneous rocks. Chalcopyrite is usually associated
with pyrite, galena, sphalerite and chalcocite, as
well as quartz, fluorite and calcite. It is found in
all the New England States, in New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North
Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, and all the Rocky
Mountain and Pacific Coast States.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Bornite">Bornite</a>

<p>Occurs in granular or compact

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Bornite is also known as erubescite, blushing
ore, variegated copper, peacock copper, etc.,
all of which names refer to the highly iridescent
tarnish which fresh faces soon take on when
exposed to the air. Though usually in masses,
it is sometimes found in rough cubes of the isometric
system. In this country it is not abundant
enough to be used as an ore, but is likely to be
found with other ores like chalcopyrite or chalcocite.
In the east it has been found at Bristol,
Conn., and near Wilkesbarre, Penn., while in
the west it may be expected to occur wherever
other sulphide minerals of copper are found.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Chalcocite">Chalcocite</a>
<br />Cu&#8322;S
<br /><a href="#Plate_9">Pl. 9</a>
<br /><i>copper glance</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in fine grained compact
masses; hardness 2.5; specific gravity
5.7; color dark leaden gray;
streak black; luster metallic; opaque
on thin edges.</p>
<p>Chalcocite is one of the important ores of
copper, especially in Arizona and the Butte
District of Montana. It resembles argentite
in color and general appearance, but is readily
distinguished by being brittle and having a
tendency to tarnish to bluish or greenish colors
on fresh surfaces. Occasionally it occurs in
crystals which are in the orthorhombic system;
but the edges of the prism are so beveled that
there are six sides and the prism resembles a
hexagonal prism (see <a href="#Page_16">page 16</a>).</p>
<p>In the Butte, Mont., district, the most important
copper region in the United States, fully 50%
of the ore is chalcocite, which is a derivative of
the originally deposited chalcopyrite, the latter
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
having lost its iron. In the veins of this district
chalcopyrite, bournite, tetrahedrite, and several
other copper minerals not described in this book,
occur all together, and with them also gold,
silver and arsenic minerals. The gold amounts
to about 2&frac14; cents per pound of copper, and the
silver is in somewhat less quantity. These veins
were first opened to get the silver ores, which
were the more important ones down to a depth
of 200 to 400 feet. Below these depths the
copper became much more important. It was
the weathering which had removed a large part
of the copper minerals in the upper levels of the
veins, but had left a large part of the silver.
Chalcocite is also important in most of the Utah
and Arizona mines.</p>
<p>In the east it has been found at Bristol, Simsbury
and Cheshire, Conn., and in the west it is
found in all the Cordilleran States.</p>

<p>Occurs in irregular masses and in
tetrahedrons of the isometric system;
hardness 3.5; specific gravity 4.7;
streak dark brown; luster metallic;
opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>In its crystalline form the tetrahedrite occurs
in tetrahedrons, which generally have faces
formed by beveling the edges and by cutting the
corners, as in the two figures of <a href="#Plate_10">plate 10</a>. Chalcopyrite
may also occur in tetrahedrons, but
its golden yellow color is entirely different from
the gray-black of the tetrahedrite. When in
masses the hardness and the streak which is dark
brown, are very characteristic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>In England and Bolivia tetrahedrite is an
important ore of copper, but in this country it is
simply a copper mineral which is widely distributed,
and associated with most of the mining
enterprises, but is in no case the important ore.
It has been found sparingly through the New
England States, at the Kellogg Mines in
Arkansas, and abundantly in Colorado, Montana,
Utah, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Cuprite">Cuprite</a>
<br />Cu&#8322;O
<br />Pl. <a href="#Plate_9">9</a> &amp; <a href="#Plate_10">10</a>
<br /><i>red copper ore</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in isometric cubes, octahedrons,
and dodecahedrons, or in
masses; hardness 3.5; specific gravity
6; color dark brownish-red;
streak brownish-red; luster metallic; translucent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>When in crystals cuprite is easily determined,
but when in masses its fresh surfaces may suggest
prousite, but the streak and hardness are
quite different in the two cases. Sometimes its
color suggests hematite, but the latter has the
hardness of 6. When found it is often coated
with a thin film of green, which is malachite.</p>
<p>Except when found as native copper, the ore
which contains the greatest percentage of copper
is cuprite with 88.8% of copper. It is likely to
occur in any of the deposits of copper ore, where
they are in arid climates and above the level of
the underground water, and is very frequently
associated with malachite and azurite. In the
Bisbee, Arizona, district cuprite is one of the
important ores.</p>
<p>Besides the normal occurrence described
above, cuprite may be found in two other varieties;
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
one where the crystals have grown side by
side and so only the ends have been free for
continuous additions of the mineral, which has
resulted in a fibrous mass known as &ldquo;plush
copper ore&rdquo; or chalcotrichite; the other an
earthy mixture of limonite and cuprite, which is
brick red in color, and termed &ldquo;tile ore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cuprite is found sparingly in New England,
more abundantly at such places as Summerville
and Flemington, N. J., Cornwall, Penn., in the
Lake Superior region, and fairly abundantly in
the Cordilleran States.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Malachite">Malachite</a>
<br />CuCO&#8323;&middot;Cu(OH)&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_11">Pl. 11</a></h3>
<p>Usually occurs in nodular or incrusting
masses; hardness 3.5;
specific gravity 4; color green; streak
a lighter green; luster adamantine, silky or dull;
translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>The vivid green of malachite is usually enough
to determine it at once, but one may be sure
by trying a drop of acid on it, in which case it
effervesces as is characteristic of so many carbonates,
but this is the only carbonate which is
vivid green. Generally the malachite is in
irregular masses, but crystals are occasionally
found. These are extremely small and needle-like,
and belong to the monoclinic system. In
the Ural Mountains there is a locality where
these crystals grow in fibrous masses, usually
radiating from the center. Malachite in such
nodules has a silky luster. These rare nodules
have furnished the rulers of Russia with a unique
and much prized material for making royal gifts.
In European museums and palaces one finds
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
many objects carved from this form of malachite,
and marked as gifts of the czars of Russia.</p>
<p>In the United States malachite is widely
distributed, appearing as green streaks and
stains where copper minerals have been exposed
to the air. It is the green tarnish which appears
on bronze and copper when exposed to the
weather. It is found in large quantities in New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona,
Utah, New Mexico, etc. The Bisbee mine
in Arizona is the place that has furnished museums
with so many of the handsome specimens
of malachite associated with azurite. These are
the most striking specimens for the vividness of
their colors that appear in any collections.</p>
<p>Malachite has been known since about 4000
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, the Egyptians having mines where they
obtained it between the Suez and Mt. Sinai.
In those early days it was particularly a child&rsquo;s
charm, protecting the wearer from evil spirits.
It is still used as a stone of lesser value in
making some sorts of jewelry.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Azurite">Azurite</a>
<br />2CuCO&#8323;&middot;Cu(OH)&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_11">Pl. 11</a></h3>
<p>Occurs as short prismatic or tabular
crystals of the monoclinic system;
hardness 4; specific gravity 3.8;
color azure blue; streak lighter blue; luster
vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Azurite is another very striking mineral fully
characterized by its color and streak. Like
malachite it effervesces in acid. It is very near
to malachite in composition, and by increasing
its water content, can and freely does change to
the green mineral; so that few specimens of
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
azurite are without traces of malachite. It is
found in the same places as malachite, but is
not as abundant in the east.</p>
<p>Azurite with the accompanying malachite is
cut and polished to make semi-precious stones
for some forms of jewelry.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Chrysocolla">Chrysocolla</a>
<br />CuSiO&#8323;&middot;2H&#8322;O</h3>
<p>Never occurs in crystals, but in
seams and incrustations; hardness
2-4; specific gravity 2.1; color bluish-green; streak
white; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>This rather rare mineral often appears in opal-
or enamel-like incrustations, and its color is
variable ranging from the typical bluish-green to
sky-blue or even turquoise blue. This is a
mineral resulting from the action of silica bearing
waters, coming in contact with most any of
the copper minerals, and is found accompanying
cuprite, malachite, azurite, etc. It is never in
large enough quantities to be used as an ore, but
its striking color attracts attention and it can be
found fairly frequently, especially in the west.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Iron Group</span></h3>
<p>Pure iron is a chemical curiosity which looks
very much like silver. As obtained from its ores,
or as it occurs in Nature, iron always has some
impurities with it, such as carbon, silicon, sulphur
and phosphorus, and these are highest in the
crudest iron such as &ldquo;pig-iron.&rdquo; Its malleability
and ductility are only a little less than for gold
and silver, and so it has a wide range of qualities
for use by man. It is only rarely found native in
minute grains in some of the dark lavas. There
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
is however one remarkable exception to this
statement, in that on Disco Island, Greenland,
there is a basaltic rock, from which are weathered
great boulders of native iron up to 20 tons in
weight. This iron is very like that occurring in
meteorites, and probably came from great depths
in the earth&rsquo;s interior. The specific gravity of
iron is 7.8. It makes up around 5% of the crust
of the earth, and probably occurs in much larger
percentages in the interior of the earth.</p>
<p>Iron was discovered by man later than gold or
silver or copper, about 1000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>; but once found
it was so much more abundant than any of
these that it soon dominated over copper, and
from Roman times to the present has been the
basis of progress in civilization, and these times
are well called &ldquo;the iron age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iron unites freely with the non-metals, and
occurs as sulphides, oxides, carbonates, etc., and
is also present as a secondary metal in that
great group of minerals known as the silicates
(see <a href="#Page_97">page 97</a>). It alloys with a wide range of
other metals, every combination altering the
properties of the iron, and thus making it useful
in a still greater range of manufacture. The
introduction of &frac14; to 2&frac12;% of carbon into iron
makes steel, which is harder (in proportion to the
amount of carbon) and stronger than the pure iron.</p>
<p>Iron compounds are among the most numerous
and important of the colors in Nature&rsquo;s paint
box, limonite furnishing the browns which color
the soil and so many of the rocks, hematite giving
the red color to other abundant rocks, and
magnetite often coloring igneous rocks black,
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
while the chlorophyll which gives the green
color to plants is an iron compound, as is also the
hemoglobin which gives the red to our blood.</p>
<p>Iron is present in all igneous rocks, and
secondarily in the sedimentary and metamorphic
rocks. It is soluble in water, and so is being
constantly transferred from place to place, and
changes from one compound to another, according
to the circumstances in which it is placed.</p>
<p>The primary forms are pyrite, magnetite and
the silicates. When in weathered rocks the iron
is changed to limonite, siderite or hydrated silicates.
Hematite is an intermediate oxide from
which the water contained in limonite has been
driven off by moderate heat or bacterial action.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Limonite">Limonite</a>
<br />2Fe&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;3H&#8322;O
<br /><a href="#Plate_12">Pl. 12</a></h3>
<p>Never crystalline, occurs in mammillary,
botryoidal and stalactitic
forms, or in fibrous, compact, oolitic,
nodular or earthly masses; hardness 5.5; specific
gravity 3.8; color yellow-brown to black; streak
yellow-brown; luster metallic to dull; opaque.</p>
<p>Limonite is a very common mineral, the color,
streak and hardness identifying it readily. Iron
rust is its most familiar form. When powdered
it is the ochre yellow used in paints. Being so
universally distributed, it is to be expected it will
occur in a variety of ways. First, there is the
fibrous type found lining cavities, in geodes, or
hanging in stalactites in caves. This has a
silky luster, an opalescent, glazed or black surface,
and is in mammillated or botryoidal masses.
Second, it may occur in compact masses in veins,
where it was deposited by waters; which, circulating
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
through the adjacent rocks, gathered it
from the rocks, and, on reaching the open seams,
gave it up again. Third, it may occur in beds
on the bottom of ponds, where it was deposited
by waters which gathered it as they flowed over
the surface of the country rocks. Measurements
in Sweden show that it may accumulate in such
places as much as six inches in the course of
twenty years. In ponds and swamps, the decaying
vegetation forms organic compounds, which
cause the precipitation of the iron from the water,
as it is brought in by the streams. This sort of
iron in the bottom of ponds or swamps is also
known as &ldquo;bog iron.&rdquo; Another form in which
limonite may occur in ponds, lakes, or even the
sea, is in oolitic masses. In this case the iron
forms in tiny balls, with perhaps a grain of sand
at the center, and one coat of iron after another
formed around it, like the layers of an onion. If
the resulting balls are tiny this is called oolitic
(like fish eggs), but if the balls are larger it is
pisolitic (like peas). Bacteria probably have a
good deal to do with the precipitation of limonite
in this manner. Fourth, limonite occurs in
earthy masses, usually mixed with impurities
like clay and sand, which are the residue left
behind, where limestones have been dissolved by
weathering. The fifth mode of occurrence is
known as gossan, or &ldquo;the iron hat,&rdquo; which is a
mass of limonite capping a vein of some sulphide
mineral, like pyrite, chalcopyrite or pyrrhotite,
which has been exposed to weathering; and in
these minerals the sulphur has been removed,
leaving a mass of limonite over the vein. This is
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
particularly common in the west. Limonite is
quite easily fusible and so was probably the
first ore from which early man extracted iron.</p>
<p>Limonite is iron oxide, with 3 molecules of
water of crystallization (or constitution) associated
with every 2 molecules of the oxide. If
limonite is moderately heated the water is
driven out and the resulting compound is hematite,
the same oxide, but without the water. In
this case and many other similar cases, as
gypsum, opal, etc., we have two or more minerals
resulting from the presence or absence of water
in the mineral. The water molecules have a
definite place in the arrangement of molecules
which determines the structure of the mineral.
Sometimes the water is driven out at a temperature
around 212 F., in which case it is called,
water of crystallization, but in other cases as
gypsum, a considerably higher temperature is
required to drive out the water, and then it is
called, water of constitution. In all cases the
removal of the water changes the arrangement of
molecules and a new mineral results, with
characteristics of its own.</p>
<p>In this case limonite is only one of a series of
minerals which have the Fe&#8322;O&#8323; molecule as a
basis, and that incorporate more or less water
into their molecular construction as follows:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="lbottom">Turgite </td><td class="lbottom">2Fe&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;H&#8322;O</td></tr>

</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Of these goethite is crystalline, the others non-crystalline.
They may occur pure or in all
sorts of mixtures, the mixtures usually being
lumped under limonite. The limonite is far
the commonest of the series, goethite is fairly
common, but the others are rare as pure
minerals.</p>
<p>Limonite is found in all parts of all states and
in every country. Though so common, it is by
no means an important source of iron today,
only about one percent of the iron mined in this
country coming from this source, though in Germany,
Sweden and Scotland it is relatively much
more important.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Goethite">Goethite</a>

<p>Goethite, named for the poet Goethe, who was
interested in mineralogy, is much less abundant
than limonite or hematite, but occurs with
them, when they are in veins. Its usual form
is an orthorhombic prism with the edges beveled,
and a low pyramid on either end. The crystals
usually grow in clusters, making a fibrous mass,
often radiated, in which case it is known as
&ldquo;needle iron stone&rdquo;; or the prisms may be so
short as to be almost scales; when, because of the
yellowish-red color, it is called &ldquo;ruby mica&rdquo;. It
is found in many states, including Connecticut,
Michigan, Colorado, etc.</p>

<p>Occurs in compact, mammillary,
botryoidal, or stalactitic masses of
dark red to black color, or in earthy
masses of bright to dark red; hardness
6; specific gravity 5.2; color ochre red to
black; streak cherry red to dark red; luster
metallic, vitreous, or dull; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>Hematite is readily distinguished from other
red minerals by its hardness and streak. It may
occur in crystals, which belong to the hexagonal
system, and are usually hemihedral forms of the
double pyramid, or rhombohedrons. These
rhombohedrons usually have the edges beveled,
as in <a href="#Plate_13">Pl. 13</a>, A; or are tabular in form as a result
of the beveling of two of the opposite edges to
such an extent that a form like <a href="#Plate_13">Pl. 13</a> B results.
However the usual occurrence is in non-crystalline
masses, which represent transformations
from limonite by the loss of water of crystallization
on the part of the limonite. In such
cases we have fibrous, oolitic or compact masses,
according to the form in which the limonite
occurred. The transformation from limonite into
hematite involves some heat to drive out the
water of crystallization, but nothing like what is
involved in metamorphism.</p>
<p>Hematite is the source of 90% of the iron
mined in this country. Part of it comes from
the famous Clinton iron ore, a layer a foot or
more in thickness; starting in New York State,
and extending all down the Appalachian Mountains
to Alabama, where it is ten or more feet
thick and the basis of the Birmingham iron
industries. Then there are tremendous deposits
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
of earthy to compact hematite, probably
derived from limonite, around the west end of
Lake Superior. This latter region yields today
around 75% of the iron for this country.</p>
<p>Loose earthy masses of hematite are often
known as &ldquo;ochre red,&rdquo; and were used by the
Indians for war paint. Today the same sort of
material is obtained by powdering hematite
and using it for red paint. The red color in
great stretches of rock is due to the presence of
small amounts of hematite, acting as cementing
material. The red of the ruby, garnet, spinel,
and the pink of feldspars and calcite are due to
traces of hematite.</p>
<p>This mineral is very common and found in
every state.</p>

<p>Occurs in masses or in isometric
octahedrons or dodecahedrons;
hardness 6; specific gravity 5.8;
color black; streak black; luster

<p>Magnetite is another important ore of iron,
and is peculiar in being strongly magnetic; its
name being derived, according to Pliny, from
that of the shepherd Magnes, who found his
iron pointed staff attracted by the mineral when
he was wandering on Mount Ida. This magnetic
property has been repeatedly used to locate
beds of magnetite, and is very helpful in separating
magnetite from the &ldquo;black sands,&rdquo; of which
it so often forms a part. These sands however
generally have magnetite with so much titanium
in it that they are unfit for smelting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Magnetite is found in association with igneous
or metamorphic rocks, and often represents
limonite or hematite which has been altered as
the result of high temperatures. Some of it,
in the igneous rocks especially, was undoubtedly
in the molten magma and has crystallized out
from the magma while it was still hot. It is the
form of iron always indicative of former high
temperatures. It is an ore mineral for about
3% of the iron in this country, but in Scandinavia
and some other countries, it plays a leading
role as the source of iron.</p>
<p>It is found in the Adirondack Mountains, in
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, North
Carolina, New Mexico, and California.</p>

3.5; specific gravity 3.8; color
gray-brown; streak white; luster vitreous; translucent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>Like hematite this mineral belongs to the
hexagonal system, and crystallizes in hemihedral
form, making the rhombohedron. Its
faces are often curved, which is rare in minerals,
only a few forms like this and dolomite having
other than plane faces. When siderite crystals
grow in clusters, the crowding often results in
growth on one face only, making a mass of
fibrous character, and in such cases the surface
of the mass is botryoidal in contour. The
mineral is likely to oxidize, losing its gray-brown
color, and becoming limonite. In the United
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
States it is scarcely ever used as an ore for iron,
but in Germany and England a great deal of iron
is smelted from this mineral.</p>
<p>It occurs in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New
York, throughout the Appalachian Mountains,
and also in Ohio.</p>

<br />FeS&#8322;
<br />Pl. <a href="#Page_15">15</a> &amp; <a href="#Page_16">16</a>
<br /><i>iron pyrites</i></h3>
<p>Occurs as cubes, octahedrons and
pyritohedrons, or in compact masses,
scales or grains; hardness 6; specific
gravity 5.1; color brassy yellow;
streak greenish-black; luster metallic; opaque
on thin edges.</p>
<p>This is one of the commonest of all minerals.
It is found in all kinds of rocks, with all kinds
of associations, in all parts of the world. Its
crystals are isometric, and cubes and octahedrons
are abundant. The pyritohedron is also a common
form, and characteristic of this mineral.
It is a hemihedral form derived from a 24-sided
form, <i>i.e.</i> the cube with four faces on each
side. On this 24-sided form each alternate face
has developed and the others have disappeared,
resulting in a 12-sided form, known as the
pyritohedron, which differs from the dodecahedron
in that each of its faces is five-sided instead
of rhomboidal. When in crystals pyrite can not
be easily confused with any other mineral; but
when in masses it is often mistaken for gold,
chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite or marcasite. From
the first two, the color should be sufficient to
distinguish it, for they are golden yellow.
Pyrrhotite is bronze yellow, and marcasite is
paler yellow. Then too in hardness pyrite is
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
much harder than any of these minerals except
marcasite. This last is the one which is most
likely to cause real difficulty. Its lighter color,
and the fact that it usually comes in fibrous
masses are the best distinctions.</p>
<p>In spite of being so abundant pyrite is scarcely
ever used as an ore for iron, because the sulphur
makes the metal &ldquo;short,&rdquo; or brittle, and the sulphur
is not easily gotten entirely out of the iron;
but pyrite is used largely in the manufacture of
sulphuric acid, so important to many of our
industries.</p>
<p>Other sulphides are commonly mixed with
pyrite, such as chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite,
argentite, etc.; but the most important impurity
is gold, which is often scattered through the
pyrite in invisible particles, and sometimes in
quantities enough to make it worth while to
smelt it for the gold.</p>
<p>Pyrite is particularly the form in which the
sulphur compounds of iron appear in rocks which
have been highly heated, and is to be expected in
metamorphic rocks and also igneous rocks,
especially in fissures and veins leading from the
igneous rocks. It may occur in sedimentary
rocks, but in these last it is usually marcasite.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Marcasite">Marcasite</a>
<br />FeS&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_15">Pl. 15</a>
<br /><i>white pyrite</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in orthorhombic crystals,
usually grouped to make fibrous or
radiating masses, or non-crystalline
in masses; hardness 6; specific gravity
4.8; color pale brassy-yellow; streak greenish-gray;
luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>Marcasite has the same chemical composition,
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
as pyrite, and looks like it, but is lighter colored
and usually occurs in fibrous masses. It is the
commoner form in limestones and shales, while
pyrite is more likely to occur in igneous and
metamorphic rocks. It seems probable that
marcasite is due to a more hasty precipitation
from cold solutions, while pyrite is deposited
more slowly from hot solutions.</p>
<p>Isolated crystals of marcasite are rare; but, if
formed, they belong to the orthorhombic system.
Usually some form of twinning is present, and
because of the multiple character of the twinning,
marcasite crystals usually show a ragged outline,
with reentrant angles. It is most abundant
in radiated masses, which appear fibrous on the
broken surfaces. It decomposes easily, taking
oxygen from the air and forming, even in
museum cases, a white efflorescence or &ldquo;flower,&rdquo;
which is iron sulphate or melanterite. In moist
air it takes water and decomposes to sulphuric
acid which may change the surrounding limestone
to gypsum. Marcasite is found wherever
limestones and shales are the country rock.</p>

<p>Occurs in masses; hardness 4;

streak grayish-black; luster metallic;
opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>Tabular crystals are known, but are very rare.
They belong to the hexagonal system. This
form is easily distinguished from the other yellow
minerals by being magnetic. It is by no means
as abundant as the two preceding sulphides of
iron, but does occur fairly frequently in veins
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
in igneous rocks, and less frequently in limestones,
large quantities of sulphuric acid being
made from a deposit in limestone at Ducktown,
Tenn. It will be found in most states. When
associated with nickel it is an important source
for the latter mineral, as at Sudbury, Canada.
Pyrrhotite is very like a substance found in
meteorites, known as troilite.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Lead Group</span></h3>
<p>After learning how to get iron from the rocks
by rude smelting methods, the early peoples tried
heating various rocks, and some time around 500
<span class="small">B.C.</span> stumbled upon lead, which is rather easily
separated from its ores. This metal was used
through Roman times to make pipes, gutters, etc.</p>
<p>Lead is a soft metal, fairly malleable, but with
little ductility, and still less tensile strength.
Though one of the commoner metals, it does not
occur as pure metal in Nature. It is diffused in
minute quantities through the igneous rocks, and
also is found in the sedimentary rocks and in
the sea water. Its minerals are few, galena, the
sulphide of lead, being the commonest, and at
the same time the form in which lead is primarily
deposited. Galena may also represent a secondary
deposition. The other minerals, cerrusite,
anglesite, and pyromorphite are results of modification
of the galena when it lies near enough to
the surface to be acted on by weathering agents,
like water and air. Lead minerals are usually
associated with zinc minerals, there being but few
places where the minerals of the one group occur
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
without the other. Most lead when first smelted
from its ore, contains a greater or less amount of
silver in it, sometimes enough so that the lead ore
is better worth working for the silver than for the
lead.</p>
<p>Lead is used in making pipes, gutters, bullets,
etc., and in its oxide forms in the manufacture of
paints and glass. Eighty-three parts of lead
with 17 parts of antimony make type metal.
Lead and tin alloy to make solder. Lead and
tin with small amounts of copper, zinc and
antimony make pewter. The United States
produce about 20% of the world&rsquo;s supply of this
metal.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Galena">Galena</a>
<br />PbS
<br /><a href="#Plate_17">Pl. 17</a>
<br /><i>lead glance</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in cubes or cleavable
masses; hardness 2.5; specific gravity
7.5; color lead-gray; streak lead-gray;
luster metallic; opaque.</p>
<p>While there is quite a group of lead-gray minerals,
galena is easily identified by its cleavage,
which is perfect in three directions parallel to
the cube faces. Even a moderate blow of the
hammer will shatter a mass of galena into small
cubic pieces. The crystals often have the corners
cut by octahedral faces, and occasionally the
edges are beveled by dodecahedral faces. It is
not uncommon to find crystals of large size,
several inches across. If galena has 1 to 2% of
bismuth as an impurity, curiously enough, the
cleavage changes to octahedral, but this is a rare
occurrence.</p>
<p>Galena may occur as a primary mineral in veins
associated with igneous intrusions, or in irregular
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
masses in metamorphic rocks; but it is more often
found in irregular masses in limestones, where the
limestone has been dissolved, and the cavities
thus formed, filled with secondary deposits of
galena. It also occurs at the contact between
igneous rocks and the adjacent rock, whatever
this may be. Sometimes it is found in residual
clays.</p>
<p>Among the most important lead deposits are
the C&oelig;ur d&rsquo;Alene district in Idaho, where
galena with a high percentage of silver is mined;
the Leadville, Colo., district where lead, silver
and gold occur together in veins; the Joplin,
Mo., district, where lead and zinc ores occur
together in irregular masses in limestones; and
the Wisconsin district of similar character.</p>
<p>When found galena is usually associated with
sphalerite, argentite chalcopyrite, pyrite and
calcite. It will be found in every state.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Cerrusite">Cerrusite</a>
<br />PbCO&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_18">Pl. 18</a>
<br /><i>White lead ore</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in fibrous or compact
masses, or in orthorhombic crystals,
usually on galena; hardness 3.5;
specific gravity 6.5; colorless; streak
white; luster adamantine; transparent on thin
edges.</p>
<p>While the crystals of this mineral simulate
hexagonal, they are actually orthorhombic, the
simple form being an octahedron with two of its
edges beveled, making double six-sided pyramids
(see <a href="#Plate_18">Pl. 18</a> A.) Usually prism faces are present.
Twinning is common, both the simple contact
sort, as shown on <a href="#Plate_18">Plate 18</a> B, and also the sort
in which three crystals have grown through each
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
other, so as to make a six-rayed crystal. The
considerable weight, and the fact that it
effervesces in acid serve to identify cerrusite.
When pure it is colorless, but impurities cause it
to appear white, gray or grayish-black, and
sometimes it has a tinge of blue or green.</p>
<p>It is likely to occur wherever galena is found,
as a secondary mineral derived from the galena.
In this country it is not used as an ore, for, as in
the Leadville district, veins which have cerrusite
near the surface change at moderate depths, and
galena takes the place of the cerrusite. It is
found all down the Appalachian Mountains, and
in all the Cordilleran States. Especially fine
specimens have come from the C&oelig;ur d&rsquo;Alene
district in Idaho.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Anglesite">Anglesite</a>
<br />PbSO&#8324;
<br /><a href="#Plate_18">Pl. 18</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in grains and masses, or in
tabular and prismatic orthorhombic
crystals; hardness 3; specific gravity
6.3; colorless; luster adamantine; transparent on
thin edges.</p>
<p>Two modes of occurrence are characteristic,
one in cavities in galena, the other in concentric
layers around a nucleus of galena. In the former
case fine crystals are developed, in the latter the
mineral is in masses. The crystals look like
those of barite, but are soluble in nitric acid
while the barite is insoluble. Sometimes the
crystals are prismatic with pyramidal faces
instead of the tabular form.</p>
<p>It is found in the lead mines associated with
galena, and in this country is not used as an ore
for lead, but in Mexico and Australia it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
abundant enough to be mined as an ore. Exposed
to water which has carbon dioxide in it,
and most surface waters have some, it readily
changes to cerrusite. It is found in Missouri,
Wisconsin, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Pyromorphite">Pyromorphite</a>

<p>Occurs in small barrel-shaped
hexagonal crystals, and in fibrous or
earthly masses; hardness 3.5; specific
gravity 7; color green to brown;
luster resinous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Pyromorphite is found in the upper levels of
lead mines, and is formed by the decomposition
of galena. Its green color (sometimes shading
off toward brown), considerable weight and
resinous luster, serve to distinguish this mineral.
The crystal form is that of a simple hexagonal
prism, with the ends truncated. It is found in
Ph&oelig;nixville, Penn., Missouri, Wisconsin, Colorado,
New Mexico, etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Zinc Group</span></h3>
<p>Zinc and copper made the brass of early
Roman times; but even then, zinc was not known
as a separate metal, the brass being made by
smelting rocks in which both zinc and copper
occurred, the zinc never being isolated until
much later. Some time in the later Roman
times it seems to have been obtained separately,
but then and all down through the Middle Ages
zinc and bismuth were confused. Our earliest
record of zinc being smelted, as we know it today,
was about 1730 in England. In those earlier
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
days, the product, zinc, or bismuth, or both
together, were known as &ldquo;spelter,&rdquo; and this
name has clung to zinc in mining and commercial
circles; so that today, if one looks for quotations
in the newspaper, he often finds zinc under the
head of spelter.</p>
<p>Zinc, like lead, is diffused in small quantities
through all the igneous rocks. In places it is
segregated in fissures or veins leading from the
igneous rocks, along the contact between igneous
rocks and either sedimentary or metamorphic
rocks, in limestones where solution cavities have
been formed and later filled with zinc minerals,
and as a residue where limestones have been
weathered away. In all these places it is closely
associated with lead.</p>
<p>The sulphide, sphalerite, is the primary
mineral, and the other minerals, like zincite,
smithsonite, calamine, willemite, franklinite, etc.,
are secondary, resulting from modifications of
the original sphalerite. In connection with zinc
minerals the region of Franklin Furnace, N. J.,
is especially interesting, for at that place are
found two large metamorphosed deposits containing
a wide range of zinc minerals, several of
which are not found anywhere else.</p>
<p>Zinc is soft and malleable, but is only slightly
ductile, and has little tensile strength. It alloys
with several metals, and in this form is most
useful today; three parts of copper to one of
zinc making brass; four or more parts of copper
and one of zinc, making &ldquo;gold foil&rdquo;; copper and
zinc (a little more zinc than copper) making
&ldquo;white metal&rdquo;; three parts of copper to one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
zinc and one of nickel making German silver;
etc. Zinc is also used in large quantities in
galvanizing iron, sheets of iron being dipped
into melted zinc and thus thinly coated. It is
also used in batteries and a wide range of chemical
industries.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Sphalerite">Sphalerite</a>

<br />Pl. <a href="#Page_19">19</a> &amp; <a href="#Page_20">20</a>
<br /><i>zinc blende, black jack</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in grains, in fibrous or
layered masses, or in isometric crystals;
hardness 3.5; specific gravity
4; color yellow-brown to almost
black; streak light yellow to brownish;
luster resinous to adamantine; translucent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>When in crystals sphalerite occurs most commonly
either in dodecahedrons or in tetrahedrons
(hemihedral forms of the isometric octahedron).
The cleavage is fairly good and parallel to the
faces of the dodecahedron. The difficulty
usually is to get large enough crystalline masses
to see this cleavage clearly, but by examining
the angles between the faces of cleavage pieces
they will be found to be the same as those on a
dodecahedron. When the mineral is pure, it has
the color of resin, but sometimes it is reddish
to red-brown, and then it is called &ldquo;ruby zinc,&rdquo;
more often it is dark brown due to the presence of
iron as an impurity. This is what the miners
call &ldquo;black-jack.&rdquo; The presence of iron also
tends to make the streak darker. The hardness,
streak and cleavage will usually determine this
mineral readily.</p>
<p>Sphalerite is the primary ore of zinc and is
usually found in fissures and veins leading from
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
masses of igneous rocks, or along the surface of
contact where igneous rocks like granite or lavas
come against such metamorphic rocks as gneisses,
schists, or crystalline limestones. In the
region of Joplin, Mo., however, the sphalerite is
of secondary character, having been gathered by
waters circulating through the limestones, and
deposited in them in irregular pockets. This
Joplin district has produced more zinc than any
other in the world. The United States annually
produces about 25% of the world&rsquo;s supply of this
metal.</p>
<p>Sphalerite is always associated with galena,
and such other minerals as argentite, pyrite,
chalcopyrite, fluorite, quartz, calcite and barite,
are very apt to be present. It will be found in
almost every state, especially in fissures and
veins, and less frequently in cavities in limestones.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Zincite">Zincite</a>
<br />ZnO
<br />Pl. <a href="#Page_19">19</a> &amp; <a href="#Page_20">20</a>

<p>Usually occurs massive, but may
be found in crystals; hardness 4;
specific gravity 5.6; color deep red;
streak orange; luster subadamantine;
translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>When in crystals zincite forms in hexagonal
prisms with hexagonal pyramids on the ends.
This is rather rare, most of the zincite being
found in massive form. The cleavage is parallel
to the prism faces and perfect. The deep red
color and orange streak are wholly
characteristic.</p>
<p>This mineral is so common at Franklin Furnace,
N. J., as to be an important ore, but it is
very seldom found elsewhere. This district, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
mentioned before, is a peculiar one for zinc
minerals. The zinc beds are in a metamorphosed
limestone, and into this are intruded
numerous dikes of granite. Probably the zinc
was originally present in the bed of limestone
as smithsonite, calamine and other secondary
minerals of zinc. When intruded by the hot
granite the smithsonite (carbonate) may well
have been altered to the oxide, zincite; while the
calamine (hydrous silicate) became the simple
silicate, willemite.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Willemite">Willemite</a>
<br />ZnSiO&#8324;
<br /><a href="#Plate_20">Pl. 20</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in masses or in crystals;
hardness 5.5; specific gravity 4.1;
color pale yellow when pure; luster
resinous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Willemite is another of the minerals which are
distinctively characteristic of Franklin Furnace,
and found elsewhere very rarely. It is so common
there as to be one of the principal ores, and
mostly occurs in irregular masses, but is also
found in crystals. These are hexagonal prisms,
with a three-sided (rhombohedral) pyramid on
the ends. The color when pure is whitish or
greenish-yellow, but with small amounts of
impurities it may be flesh-red, grayish-white or
yellowish-brown. When in crystals it is easily
determined; but when massive it looks like
calamine, and can only be distinguished by placing
a bit of the mineral in a closed tube and
heating it, in which case calamine will give off
water vapor, while willemite will not.</p>
<p>This mineral is one of those resulting from
metamorphic alteration and is derived from
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
calamine, when the latter loses its water of
crystallization. It is common at Franklin
Furnace, N. J., and also found occasionally
elsewhere, as at Salida, Colo., and in Socorro Co.,
New Mexico.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Calamine">Calamine</a>
<br />Zn&#8322;(OH)&#8322;&middot;SiO&#8323;</h3>
<p>Occurs as crystalline linings in
cavities, or as botryoidal or stalactitic
masses; hardness 5; specific gravity 3.4; colorless
to white; luster vitreous.</p>
<p>Calamine resembles both smithsonite and
willemite when in non-crystalline masses. From
the smithsonite it is easily separated by the
fact that in nitric acid the smithsonite effervesces
and the calamine does not. From willemite it is
harder to distinguish, but a piece may be placed
in a closed tube and heated. If it is calamine
water vapor will be given off, if willemite nothing
happens. When calamine occurs in crystals
these are orthorhombic and mostly tabular, and
the crystals are peculiar in that the two ends are
terminated differently.</p>
<p>Both this and smithsonite are secondary
minerals and usually occur together when zinc is
found in limestones. It is abundant at Franklin
Furnace and Sterling Hill, N. J., and also found
at Ph&oelig;nixville, Penn., in Wythe Co., Va., and
Granby, Mo.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Smithsonite">Smithsonite</a>

greenish or bluish; streak white; luster vitreous;
transparent on thin edges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>When pure this mineral is colorless, but, as it
occurs, it is usually white, or tinged with some
shade of yellow, green, or blue, but in all cases its
streak is white. The crystals are rhombohedrons
often with edges beveled or corners cut by other
faces. It resembles calamine and willemite, but
is readily separated from either of these by the
acid test, for smithsonite effervesces when acid
is placed on it.</p>
<p>Next to sphalerite, smithsonite is the commonest
of the zinc minerals. It is a secondary
mineral, resulting from the action of lime-charged
water acting on sphalerite, and so is
likely to be found wherever zinc minerals occur
in a limestone region. In the Wisconsin-Illinois-Iowa
district it serves as a minor ore of zinc, and
is termed here &ldquo;dry bone.&rdquo; It is also found in
the Missouri and Arkansas districts, and in
Europe is an important ore for zinc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Franklinite">Franklinite</a>
<br />(ZnMn)Fe&#8322;O&#8324;

<p>Occurs in compact grains or

hardness 6; specific gravity
5; color black; streak reddish-brown; luster
metallic; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>This is a mineral peculiar to the Franklin Furnace
region, from which it gets its name. It
looks like magnetite, but its reddish-brown
streak and lack of magnetism distinguish it.
When it occurs in octahedrons, the edges are
rounded, while those of magnetite are sharp. It
is a complex and variable oxide of zinc, iron and
manganese, which has resulted from the metamorphism
of the beds in which it occurred
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
probably being originally something quite
different.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Manganese Group</span></h3>
<p>Though manganese was known in the mineral
pyrolusite in early times, it was then thought to
be magnetite or magnetic iron ore. It was not
until 1774 that it was isolated and recognized
as a distinct element.</p>
<p>Manganese is one of the lesser elements in the
crust of the earth, making less than .07 of one
percent, but as an alloy with other metals,
especially iron, it has attained a considerable
importance to man. It is used chiefly with iron,
20% of manganese making the alloy, spiegeleisen,
a combination which occurs in Nature in Germany,
and from 20% to 80% making ferromanganese.
These alloys are in great demand
because they make an especially tough steel essential
in the manufacture of munitions. The
sources for manganese are the oxide ores, manganite,
pyrolusite and psilomelane, which have
been formed as secondary minerals, as a result of
the weathering of silicates which carry manganese.
They occur widely enough, but throughout
the United States the deposits are small, and this
is one of the elements in which this country is not
self-sufficient. The largest producer of manganese
is Russia; however she consumes almost all of her
output at home, and our supply comes from the
next largest producers, India, the Union of South
Africa, and the Gold Coast. A shift in trade may
be expected when Brazil&rsquo;s recently discovered ore
body in Matto Grosso is brought into full production.
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
Besides being used as an alloy, manganese is
employed in making paints and dyes, for clearing
glass, and for some types of electric batteries.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Pyrolusite">Pyrolusite</a>
<br />MnO&#8322;</h3>
<p>Occurs in earthy or fibrous masses;
hardness 1-2; specific gravity 4.8;
color black; streak black; luster
dull; opaque.</p>
<p>Pyrolusite occurs in soft masses and incrustations,
usually leaving a sooty mark on the fingers.
Sometimes it seems to be in crystals, but these
are pseudomorphs which have the form of manganite,
from which the pyrolusite has formed as a
result of the water having been driven from the
manganite. Frequently pyromorphite and manganite
will be found together, and in some cases
the outer part of a mass or crystal will be pyrolusite,
while the center is still manganite. Psilomelane
is another oxide of manganese with
water and may appear very like pyrolusite, but
both manganite and psilomelane have much
greater hardness than does pyrolusite. If there
is difficulty in deciding about pyrolusite, it may
be placed in a closed tube and heated. It will
not be affected by the heat, while, under the
same circumstances, both manganite and psilomelane
will give off water vapor.</p>
<p>Pyrolusite usually occurs in black streaks or
pockets in residual clays which have formed as a
result of the decomposition of limestones. It
may also occur in dendritic forms in seams and
crevices (see manganite). It is found in Vermont,
Massachusetts, Virginia, Arkansas, Colorado,
California, etc.</p>

<br />MnO&#8322;&middot;H&#8322;O</h3>
<p>Occurs in compact botryoidal or
stalactitic masses; hardness 5-6;
specific gravity 4.2; color black;
streak brownish-black; luster metallic; opaque
on thin edges.</p>
<p>Psilomelane is very like pyrolusite, and often
occurs with it. It is distinguished by its greater
hardness, and the fact, that when heated in a
closed tube, it gives off water vapor. From
manganite it is more easily distinguished, for it
never occurs in crystals, while the manganite is
usually crystalline. This and pyrolusite are the
principal ores of manganese.</p>
<p>Wad is an impure form of psilomelane, having
some iron oxide mixed with the manganese oxide,
usually limonite; or the impurity may take the
form of a copper, cobalt, lithium or barium
oxide.</p>
<p>Psilomelane is found at Brandon, Vt., in
Arkansas, Colorado, California, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Manganite">Manganite</a>
<br />Mn&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;H&#8322;O
<br /><a href="#Plate_22">Pl. 22</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in prismatic crystals, or in
columnar or fibrous masses; hardness
4; specific gravity 4.4; color
steel gray; streak reddish-black; luster submetallic;
opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>This is the form taken by manganese oxide
when it crystallizes in the presence of moisture,
and pyrolusite frequently changes to manganite
when exposed to moisture. The crystals are
orthorhombic prisms, with striated sides and the
ends truncated. These prisms usually occur in
bundles and give the mineral a fibrous appearance.
Manganite is not hard to identify, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
striations on the crystals and the streak being
very characteristic.</p>
<p>In seams and tiny crevices this mineral, and
often pyrolusite, grows in a branching manner,
resembling tree-like or &ldquo;mossy&rdquo; masses. This is
termed dendritic, and the growths of manganese
minerals are called dendrites. One of the most
curious of these is when the &ldquo;mossy&rdquo; growth is
inclosed in chalcedony, making the so-called <i>moss
agate</i>. These moss agates are abundant through
the Rocky Mountains and are frequently cut for
semi-precious stones. The finest ones however
come from India and China.</p>
<p>Manganite is found in the Lake Superior
region, Colorado, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Rhodochrosite">Rhodochrosite</a>
<br />MnCO&#8323;</h3>
<p>Occurs in compact cleavable
masses; hardness 4; specific gravity
3.5; color rose to dark red; streak
white; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>This usually occurs in pink to red masses which
cleave readily parallel to the faces of the rhombohedron.
When it is found in crystals, which
are rare, these too are rhombohedrons. It is
usually found in veins as a gangue mineral with
copper, silver or zinc ores. Its beautiful color and
the fact that it effervesces in acid serve to distinguish
this mineral. It is found at Branchville,
Conn., at Franklin Furnace, N. J., and in veins
with silver in Colorado, Nevada, and Montana.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Aluminum Group</span></h3>
<p>Though aluminum is one of the most abundant
of all the metals, making some 8% of the crust of
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the earth, its union with other elements is so
firm, that only recently have methods been
found for getting the metal free. It was first
isolated in 1846, but up to 1890 the extraction of
aluminum was so expensive, that it could not be
widely used. About that time electrical processes
were applied to its extraction, and since then the
price has steadily dropped, until now it is under
$.20 per pound. It is very malleable, and ductile,
and has high tensile strength. Exposed to
the air, water or ordinary gases, it does not
tarnish; and it is very light, an equal bulk weighing
about a third as much as iron. The combination
of lightness and strength, and the fact
that it is a good conductor of electricity, have
made it available for a wide range of uses, such
as electrical apparatus, delicate instruments,
boats, aeroplanes, and domestic utensils.</p>
<p>It is an essential component of all the important
rocks, except sandstone and limestone, and
combines to a greater or less degree in a host of
minerals. Though present in clays, shales,
argillites, feldspars, and micas, it is only from
bauxite that it has been successfully extracted.
Aside from the small number of simple compounds
of aluminum grouped here, it also takes
a part in the make-up of a large series of minerals
termed silicates, treated a little further on in
this book.</p>
<p>It alloys with other metals, especially copper.
The union of copper and a small amount of
aluminum makes aluminum-bronze, which looks
like gold and is used for watch chains, pencil-cases,
etc., and also for the antifriction bearings
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
of heavy machinery. A small amount added to
steel prevents air holes and cracks in casting.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Corundum">Corundum</a>
<br />Al&#8322;O&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_23">Pl. 23</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in cleavable masses or in
hexagonal crystals; hardness 9;
specific gravity 4; colorless, red,
yellow, blue, or gray; luster vitreous to adamantine;
translucent to transparent on thin
edges.</p>
<p>Corundum is readily recognized by its hardness,
second only to that of the diamond. The
crystals may be simple six-sided prisms, hexagonal
pyramids or combinations of the two.
The cleavage is usually described as parting, for
it is by no means perfect, but when it is recognizable
it is parallel to the faces of a rhombohedron,
and cleavage pieces may appear almost cubic.</p>
<p>When in clear and perfect crystals this mineral
is one of the most highly prized of all the gems.
Clear and colorless it is known as the &ldquo;<i>Oriental
white sapphire</i>&rdquo;; when tinged with blue it is the
<i>sapphire</i>; when colored yellow, the &ldquo;<i>Oriental
topaz</i>&rdquo;; when green, the &ldquo;<i>Oriental emerald</i>&rdquo;;
when purple, the &ldquo;<i>Oriental amethyst</i>&rdquo; and when
red, the <i>ruby</i>. Sapphires range from colorless
to deep blue, the value depending on the shade
of the blue, and increasing as the color deepens.
The Oriental topaz can easily be confused with
the true topaz, which is a much commoner and
less valuable gem, but can be distinguished by
the hardness, topaz having a hardness of but 8.
The name emerald is applied to several green
gems, mostly to beryl, which is not so hard and
is the true emerald. The Oriental emeralds have
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
a value about the same as diamonds. Rubies of
clear and deep color are the rarest of all gems,
ranging in value about three times as high as
diamonds of equal size. The most sought-for
shade is the so-called &ldquo;pigeon-blood red,&rdquo; and
the value of a stone of this sort is almost dependent
on the whim of the buyer. The best of
the rubies come from granites or metamorphosed
limestones in Burma; the best sapphires from
Ceylon, though both of these, and some of the
other corundums of gem quality, have been
found in North Carolina and Montana.</p>
<p>Around these stones, which have been used so
long among the Hindus, Persians, Jews, Egyptians,
and Christians, a wealth of lore has been
woven. The sapphire was Saturn&rsquo;s stone, and a
talisman to attract Divine favor. Where tradition
makes the stone on which the ten commandments
were written the sapphire, it is probable
that, what was really meant, is lapis lazuli,
as is also the case when sapphires are mentioned
as building stones for the celestial gates. The
ruby in ancient lore is termed &ldquo;lord of stones,&rdquo;
&ldquo;gem of gems&rdquo; etc., and so protected its wearer
that he was safe from injury in peace or war.</p>
<p>When corundum is colored brown by impurities
of iron, it is termed <i>corundum</i>, when black
by greater quantities of iron, it is <i>emery</i>. These
varieties are far the commonest form in which
corundum occurs, and when ground to finer or
coarser powder make the commercial emery.
Emery is likely to be found in sands, making so-called
&ldquo;black sands,&rdquo; where it has accumulated
as a result of the weathering to bits corundum-bearing
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
rocks. In some one of its forms, corundum
is found in Massachusetts, Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, and all down the Appalachian
Mountains, also in Colorado, Montana,
California, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Bauxite">Bauxite</a>
<br />Al&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;2H&#8322;O</h3>
<p>Occurs in grains, or oolitic or
clay-like masses; hardness 1-3; specific
gravity 2.5; color white to yellowish-white
or reddish-brown.</p>
<p>Bauxite never comes in crystals, but is usually
in earthy masses, which have resulted from the
decomposition of granitic or volcanic rocks, in
circumstances where hot alkaline waters were
present. This explanation seems to apply
especially to the deposits in France, which were
first the chief source of the bauxite, and may be
applicable to those in Georgia and Alabama.
Some of the other deposits, however, do not
seem to have had any hot water available, and
the deposit appears more like simple decomposition
of the underlying rocks by alkaline
waters.</p>
<p>In many cases bauxite resembles limonite in
being a mixture of two or more aluminum oxides
with water of crystallization, such as Al&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;H&#8322;O,
Al&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;2H&#8322;O and Al&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;3H&#8322;O. This is particularly
true of the bauxite which resulted from
the decomposition of rocks by surface water.</p>
<p>Bauxite is the ore from which aluminum is
obtained. The deposits are not large, but the
United States has its share of them. It is found
in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee,
and California.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h3><a id="species_Cryolite">Cryolite</a>
<br />Na&#8323;AlF&#8326;
<br /><i>Ice stone</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in pseudo-cubic crystals or
massive; hardness 2.5; specific gravity
3; color white; luster vitreous;
transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Cryolite is a relatively soft mineral, colorless
to white as snow; for which reason, and partly
also because it comes mostly from Greenland
it is called &ldquo;ice stone.&rdquo; It is really monoclinic
but the inclination of the c axis is so slight, that,
unless examined carefully, the crystals appear
to be cubic. Until about 1900 great quantities
of this mineral were shipped from West Greenland,
and from them the metal aluminum was
extracted. When bauxite was discovered, it was
found to be considerably cheaper to make the
aluminum from that mineral, and now cryolite
is no longer sought. Aside from its occurrence
in Greenland some cryolite is found in Colorado,
near Pike&rsquo;s Peak.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Arsenic Group</span></h3>
<p>The metal, arsenic, is a dark steel gray in
color, when the surface is fresh, but it soon tarnishes.
It is very brittle and easily powdered
under the hammer, and its only use as a metal,
is for an alloy with lead in making shot. Its
compounds find a wider use. The white powder
called &ldquo;arsenic&rdquo; is arsenous acid, and is used
mostly in making poisons, which fortunately
are easily detected in animal tissues. Copper
arsenate, (<i>Scheele&rsquo;s green</i>) is a pigment used in
making green paint, and formerly in the green
colors of wall paper. A combination of arsenous
acid, copper oxide and acetic acid is the well
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
known <i>Paris Green</i>, so much used for an insecticide.
Beside these uses, arsenic serves a large
number of other purposes, as in making glass
and enamel, embalming fluids, and various
medicines.</p>
<p>Curiously arsenic plays a double part, acting
part of the time as a metal, as in the two following
minerals, and part of the time as a non-metal,
as in cobaltite, niccolite, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Arsenopyrite">Arsenopyrite</a>
<br />FeAsS
<br /><a href="#Plate_24">Pl. 24</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in well formed crystals,
grains, or masses; hardness 5.5;
specific gravity 6; color silver-white;
streak black; luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>When in crystals, they are usually short prisms
of the orthorhombic system, either end being
terminated with a low roof. Though usually
described as silver-white in color, there is always
a brassy cast to the color. Its appearance is
much like cobaltite and smaltite, but it can be
easily distinguished from both these by putting
a piece in nitric acid. The arsenopyrite will not
materially change the color of the fluid, but the
other two turn it rose-red, and all give off the
smell of sulphur. It looks sometimes like marcasite,
but that is yellower, and has the fibrous
structure, not found in arsenopyrite.</p>
<p>It is found in veins or in metamorphic rocks,
associated with argentite, galena, sphalerite,
chalcopyrite and pyrite. It is distinctly a
mineral formed by deposition from hot vapors or
hot water rising from either lavas, or in the
course of metamorphism.</p>
<p>It is found in New Hampshire, Vermont,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New
Jersey, California, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Realgar">Realgar</a>
<br />AsS
<br /><a href="#Plate_24">Pl. 24</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in incrustations or scattered
grains; hardness 1.5 to 2; specific
gravity 3.5; color orange; streak
orange; luster resinous; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>Crystals are very rare, but when found are
short monoclinic prisms. The color is aurora-red,
changing to orange as soon as it is exposed
to the air. This and the streak are entirely
characteristic. It is a mineral associated with
hot vapors or hot waters, and is found about
volcanoes, as deposits from the hot water of the
geysers in Norris Basin, Yellowstone Park, and
in veins, associated with barite, stibnite, quartz,
etc., as in Massachusetts, Utah, California, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Orpiment">Orpiment</a>
<br />As&#8322;S&#8323;</h3>
<p>Occurs as incrustations or
powdery masses; hardness 1 to 2;
specific gravity 3.5; color lemon
yellow; streak yellow; luster resinous.</p>
<p>This mineral is very like realgar in its physical
properties, and likely to occur with it. It gives
the lemon yellow color to the basins about hot
springs, as in the Yellowstone Park, and about
volcanoes. It also comes in veins with realgar.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Molybdenum</span></h3>
<p>Molybdenum is a rare metal, silvery-white in
color, brittle and very difficult to fuse. It is used
mostly as an alloy of steel, to make certain
grades of tool steel. The world&rsquo;s greatest supply
is obtained from Climax, Colorado, where the
principal ore mineral is molybdenite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h3><a id="species_Molybdenite">Molybdenite</a>
<br />MoS&#8322;</h3>
<p>Occurs in scales or scaly masses,
occasionally in tabular hexagonal
crystals; hardness 1.5; specific gravity
4.7; color lead-gray; streak bluish-gray;
luster metallic; opaque.</p>
<p>This mineral is the chief source for the metal
molybdenum. Its extreme softness and greasy
feel will distinguish it at once from any other
mineral except graphite, which has much the
same qualities, but its scaly character and the
more bluish tinge in streak and color will distinguish
these two.</p>
<p>It occurs in granites, gneisses, and metamorphic
rocks in Colorado, New Mexico, Maine,
Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania,
etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Antimony</span></h3>
<p>Antimony is another hard, brittle metal, of
bluish-white color. Exposed to the air at ordinary
temperatures it does not tarnish; and this
combined with its hardness make it useful for
such alloys as Britannia metal, type metal, and
pewter. Only one of its minerals, stibnite, is
common enough for mention.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Stibnite">Stibnite</a>
<br />Sb&#8322;S&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_25">Pl. 25</a>
<br /><i>gray antimony</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in prismatic or needle-like
crystals; hardness 2; specific gravity
4.5; color lead-gray; streak lead-gray;
luster metallic; opaque.</p>
<p>The crystals of stibnite are orthorhombic
and usually elongated,
the sides striated and the ends with low pyramids
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
on them. Sometimes the long crystals are
curved or even twisted. There is a well-developed
cleavage parallel to face b in the figure.
While the color is similar to that of galena, the
form and cleavage are so different that stibnite
is easily determined.</p>
<p>The ancients used stibnite to color their eyebrows,
now it is the source for the metal antimony.
Hungary and Japan are famous for the
fine large crystals they produce; but moderate
sized crystals may be found in this country. It
occurs in veins along with pyrite, galena, cinnabar,
and realgar, with quartz, calcite or barite
as gangue minerals.</p>
<p>Stibnite has been found in Arkansas, California,
Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Nickel Group</span></h3>
<p>Nickel as a metal is silvery-white in color,
rather hard, and does not tarnish when exposed
to the air. When pure it is malleable and fairly
ductile. It is highly useful for plating other
metals to protect their surfaces. Alloyed with
steel, it makes a product of extreme hardness.
Copper, zinc, and nickel make the well known
German silver.</p>
<p>Nickel has a fairly large range of minerals,
but they do not occur with any abundance in
the United States, so that we have to import
most all of our nickel. In the earlier days New
Caledonia produced most of the world&rsquo;s supply,
but recently since the finding of large nickel
deposits near Sudbury, Canada, this locality has
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
not only outstripped New Caledonia, but now
produces four-fifths of the world&rsquo;s supply. In
this country but two nickel minerals will be
found at all common.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Niccolite">Niccolite</a>
<br />NiAs
<br /><a href="#Plate_25">Pl. 25</a>
<br /><i>copper nickel</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in masses; hardness 5.5;
specific gravity 7.4; color pale coppery-yellow;
streak pale brownish-black;
luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>Niccolite is very seldom in crystals, but if
they do occur they are hexagonal. The mineral
looks a little like smaltite, but in case there is
any question of the determination, dissolve a
piece in nitric acid, and if niccolite, it will color
the solution green.</p>
<p>Niccolite is usually associated with copper
and silver ores, and in this country has been
found at Chatham, Conn., and Silver Cliff,
Colo. It may be associated with pentlandite, a
sulphide of iron and nickel, which is similar in
appearance, but not so hard, and occurs in small
grains throughout dark lavas. The particles of
pentlandite are however so small, that they are
seldom noticeable, but at Sudbury, Canada, this
is the chief ore of nickel.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Millerite">Millerite</a>
<br />NiS
<br /><i>capillary pyrites</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in needle-like or fibrous
crystals; hardness 3.5; specific gravity
5.5; color brass-yellow; streak
greenish black; luster metallic;
opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>The fibrous crystals of millerite belong to the
orthorhombic system. The color and streak
suggest pyrite, but the crystals are long and
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
slender, while pyrite is in cubes, octahedrons,
etc. If there is any doubt of the identity of this
form, place a piece in nitric acid, and if it is
millerite, it will color the acid green.</p>
<p>It may occur in veins associated with cobalt
and silver minerals, or as a secondary mineral as
at Gap Mine, Penn., or in cavities in sedimentary
rocks. In the last case it usually is in
needle-like crystals growing through calcite
crystals, as at St. Louis, Mo., Keokuk, Iowa,
and Antwerp, N. Y.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Cobalt Group</span></h3>
<p>As a metal, cobalt is hard, brittle, and of a
grayish color, tinged with red. It was not recognized
as a separate element until 1735, and
even today is one of the minor metals. Cobalt,
chromium and a little tungsten make the alloy
stellite, which has come into large use in making
high-speed tools. The oxide of cobalt (CoO) is
&ldquo;smalt,&rdquo; used to give the blue color to porcelain,
pottery, glass, tiles, etc. Invisible ink is made by
diluting cobalt chloride in a large quantity of
water. This solution is a faint pink color and
practically invisible on paper, but if heated it
loses water and turns blue in color, and is perfectly
visible.</p>
<p>Cobalt is another of the metals, of which the
United States does not have an adequate supply.
Sweden, Norway and India were the chief
sources of supply until cobalt was found near the
town of Cobalt in Ontario, Canada, and now
this district furnishes 90% of the world&rsquo;s supply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h3><a id="species_Cobaltite">Cobaltite</a>
<br />CoAsS
<br /><a href="#Plate_26">Pl. 26</a>
<br /><i>cobalt glance</i></h3>
<p>Usually crystalline in cubes, pyritohedrons
or octahedrons; hardness
5.5; specific gravity 6.1; color reddish
silver-white; streak grayish-black;
luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>In color cobaltite may appear very like arsenopyrite,
especially if the reddish tinge is not
strong, in which case the mineral can be definitely
determined by putting a piece in nitric
acid. If it is cobaltite the solution will be
colored rose-red, if arsenopyrite there will be no
change of color. The forms of the crystals are
the same as those of pyrite, but the color will
easily distinguish cobaltite from pyrite. This
pink color is characteristically present either in
or about cobalt minerals, being sometimes called
&ldquo;cobalt bloom.&rdquo; It is a cobalt-arsenic-oxide
with water of crystallization (Co&#8323;As&#8322;O&#8328;&middot;8H&#8322;O),
which results from the exposure of cobalt and
arsenic minerals to air and moisture. It is the
pink color on the figures of both cobaltite and
smaltite. In Sweden, Norway and India, this is
the chief ore for cobalt, but in the United States
it is rather rare, but is found in Oregon, and at
Cobalt, Canada.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Smaltite">Smaltite</a>
<br />(CoNi)As&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_26">Pl. 26</a>
<br /><i>gray cobalt ore</i></h3>
<p>Usually occurs in masses; hardness
5.5; specific gravity 6.2; color
tin-white to steel-gray; streak grayish-black;
luster metallic; opaque
on thin edges.</p>
<p>While very like cobaltite, smaltite is almost
never found in crystals, but when crystals are
found, they are cubes. The color is tin-white
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
but there is usually a pink tinge visible due to the
presence of small amounts of &ldquo;cobalt bloom.&rdquo;
If in any doubt about the determination of this
mineral, put a piece in nitric acid. If it colors
the acid rose-pink, and is non-crystalline it is
pretty surely smaltite; if the acid is not affected
it is arsenopyrite.</p>
<p>Smaltite is found in Kentucky, Missouri,
Colorado, Idaho, California, and at Cobalt in
Canada.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Chromium</span></h3>
<p>This metal gets its name in recognition of the
many colors (<i>chroma</i> &ldquo;color&rdquo;), in which its
compounds appear. Chromic oxide is a vivid
green, used to color porcelains, pottery, tiles,
etc., and also as a substitute for the arsenical
greens formerly used in wall-paper. The chromate
of lead is the pigment, well known to artists
as &ldquo;chrome yellow,&rdquo; and the bichromate of
potassium is bright red. The metal is obtained
in at least two different forms; one hard, brittle
and so resistant to heat as to be infusible at
temperatures which would volatilize platinum;
the other as a powder which burns brightly if
heated in air. While used in paints, dyes, etc.,
its greatest importance is for the making of
ferro-chrome steel, which is used where resistance
to sudden shock is required, as in armor
plate, automobile springs, ball bearings, etc.
With tungsten and cobalt it makes the alloy,
stellite, as noted above.</p>
<p>Chromium was used in relatively small quantities
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
before the first world war, and we imported
our supplies from Turkey, India, New Caledonia,
and Rhodesia. During the last war we started a
large-scale development of low-grade ores in
Montana, and can now supply all of our needs
from this source.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Chromite">Chromite</a>
<br />FeCr&#8322;O&#8324;
<br /><i>chromic iron</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in grains, masses, or isometric
octahedrons; hardness 5.5;
specific gravity 4.4; color black;
streak dark-brown; luster submetallic; opaque
on thin edges.</p>
<p>In form, color and streak chromite resembles
magnetite and franklinite. From the magnetite
it is distinguished by being non-magnetic; from
the franklinite, by being insoluble in hydrochloric
acid, while the franklinite is soluble.
Chromite furnishes practically all the chromium
used in the arts and manufactures. It is a
mineral associated with high temperatures, and
therefore found in dark lavas, serpentine, and
olivine. It occurs in Pennsylvania, Maryland,
New Jersey, Montana, Oregon, Wyoming, and
California.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Tungsten</span></h3>
<p>This element is obtained either as a heavy
dark-gray metal, which is very hard and difficult
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
to fuse, or as a dark-gray powder. It is used as
an alloy with iron, one part of tungsten to nine
of steel, to make the ferrotungsten, which has
extraordinary hardness, and is used mostly for
high-speed tools. Tungsten is also one of the
three metals (cobalt, chromium and tungsten)
which are alloyed together to make stellite.
Some of the tungsten supply is also used to
make the films in incandescent lamps, and in
some of the chemical industries. It has but one
important ore, wolframite, and this is found in
the United States in but small quantities; so
that we ordinarily have to import the greater
part of what we use. During the last war, under
the stimulus of high prices and the urge of necessity,
we did find and produce substantial quantities
of tungsten. China is the world&rsquo;s largest
producer of tungsten ore with Burma second, and
the United States a poor third.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Wolframite">Wolframite</a>
<br />(FeMn)WO&#8324;</h3>
<p>Occurs in monoclinic crystals or
in crystalline masses; hardness 5.5;
specific gravity 7.4; color dark-brown
to black; streak nearly black; luster
submetallic; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>If in crystals the form will serve to distinguish
this mineral from cassiterite and ilmenite, the
two which it most resembles; but if it is massive
the only sure way to decide is to put a piece in
strong sulphuric acid; if it dissolves and throws
down a yellow precipitate (tungstic acid) it is
wolframite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Like the two other minerals mentioned above
it occurs in veins in igneous rocks, being associated
with high temperatures. As it is almost
insoluble in water, like cassiterite and ilmenite,
it is likely to occur with them in the sands which
are the result of the disintegration of the rocks
which carried the minerals; and so a large part
of the supply today comes from placer deposits.</p>
<p>It is found in Connecticut, North Carolina,
Missouri, Colorado, and California.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Radium, Uranium and Vanadium</span></h3>
<p>These three metals are all rare and occur
together. Radium, discovered in 1898, is a
heavy metal which has proved very useful
because of its radio-activity, that is, its power of
giving off or radiating tiny particles of matter
known as <i>X-rays</i>, part of which are charged with
positive electricity, and part of them with
negative electricity. The ability of these rays
to pass through other substances has made
possible photographing the denser substances
within those less dense, as the bones within the
flesh, or metal within leather or wood, etc.
The rays have proved of great value medicinally,
and are also used to make objects luminous in
the dark. These X-rays are also used in the
study of the ultimate structure of matter, as it
can be thus obtained in such small units.</p>
<p>Uranium is another element which is radio-active
and can be used for many of the same
purposes as radium.</p>
<p>Vanadium, the third of these associated metals,
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
and the commonest of the group, is not radio-active.
It is a silvery-white metal, mostly used
as an alloy with steel to give it great hardness.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Carnotite">Carnotite</a>
<br />K&#8322;O&middot;2U&#8322;O&#8323;&middot;V&#8322;O&#8325;&middot;3H&#8322;O
<br /><a href="#Plate_27">Pl. 27</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in earthy masses; color yellow.</p>
<p>This mineral is included here, not
because it is common, but because
it is of such great interest. It is the chief source
of supply in the United States of radium, uranium
and vanadium. It is a lemon-yellow earth
or powder, which looks a little like orpiment.
It is however found in a sandstone, instead of
where hot waters have deposed minerals. From
a ton of this ore about 10 pounds of uranium
oxide, 55 pounds of vanadium and &sup1;/&#8321;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320;th of a
gram of radium are obtained. Carnotite is found
in south-west Colorado and south-east Utah, and
on Carrizo Mountain on the line between Arizona
and New Mexico.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Mercury</span></h3>
<p>Mercury, or quicksilver, is the only metal
which is liquid at ordinary temperatures. It is
silvery-white in color, with a striking metallic
luster, and at the low temperature of 662&deg; F.,
boils and changes to a colorless vapor. Mercury
alloys with certain metals, these alloys being
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
known as amalgams. In this way it is especially
useful for the recovery of gold and silver, the
mercury being added to crushed ore, the gold or
silver uniting with the mercury in a liquid amalgam,
which is then drawn off and heated to a
temperature above 662&deg; F., at which temperature
the mercury volatilizes and is recovered, while
the gold or silver remains behind. Mercury
also forms a solid amalgam with tin which is
used to coat glass, the high metallic luster
making the most effective looking glass. It is
also used in medicines (calomel, corrosive sublimate,
etc.), for scientific instruments (thermometers,
barometers, etc.), in cosmetics, in
paints for ship bottoms, etc.</p>
<p>Though there are some 25 minerals of mercury,
only one is common or important as a
source of the metal, cinnabar. The United
States is self-sufficient as far as mercury is concerned,
producing just about as much as it
uses. The leading producers are Spain, Austria,
Italy, and the United States. Commercially
mercury is quoted as quicksilver, and in flasks
of 75 pounds each.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Cinnabar">Cinnabar</a>
<br />HgS
<br /><a href="#Plate_27">Pl. 27</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in massive or earthy form,
or in minute crystals in cavities;
hardness 2.5; specific gravity 8;
color scarlet to dark red; streak vermilion;
luster adamantine; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>The bright-red color and the streak are usually
enough to identify this mineral at once, but some
of the darker varieties resemble hematite or
zincite in appearance, but both these have much
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
greater hardness. When in crystals they are
tiny hexagonal prisms with pyramids on the end.
Cinnabar is usually found in or near metamorphic
or igneous rocks, either in veins leading
from the igneous rocks, or in metamorphic rocks,
or it may occur disseminated through metamorphic
rocks. It is associated with quartz or
calcite, and may occur with other sulphides
like pyrite, galena, argentite, etc. It is most
abundant in California, but is also found in
Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Nevada,
Utah, Texas, and Montana.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Tin</span></h3>
<p>Tin has been known since early Roman times,
and the mines at Cornwall, England, were worked
from that time all through down to the present,
but now they are becoming of minor importance
as they approach exhaustion. The metal is
silvery-white, does not easily tarnish, is
malleable, but has little ductility and little
tensile strength. Tin is mostly used in making
tin plate, a thin sheet of steel covered with tin,
the tin being only 1 to 2% of the total weight.
This tin plate is mostly made into tin cans, and
used as containers for food. Some tin is used in
making solder, tin-foil, tubes for paste, vaseline,
etc., and around 1000 tons per year for weighting
silk. This &ldquo;weighting&rdquo; makes the silk heavier
by about 25% and gives it a &ldquo;rustle,&rdquo; which,
while much in evidence, is really indicative that
the silk is not pure. The United States produces
very little tin, most of the world&rsquo;s supply coming
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
from the Malay Peninsula, Dutch East Indies,
China, and Bolivia, with small amounts from
several other countries.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Cassiterite">Cassiterite</a>
<br />SnO&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_28">Pl. 28</a>
<br /><i>tin stone</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in tetragonal crystals,
massive, or in grains and pebbles;
hardness 6.5; specific gravity 7;
color black or dark-brown; streak gray; luster
adamantine; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>The crystals are short prisms with pyramidal
ends. Twinning is common. Cassiterite also
occurs in fibrous masses, and when it is weathered
from its original location, is so insoluble and
hard, that it remains as grains and pebbles,
making placer-deposits, from which today three
quarters of the supply is obtained. If pure, the
crystals would be colorless, but impurities of
iron and titanium give it the dark-brown to
black color. Cassiterite may appear very like
rutile, the crystalline forms being identical, but
the reddish tinge of color in the rutile will
separate the two.</p>
<p>Cassiterite is one of those minerals which result
from deposition at very high temperatures,
probably from vapors, and is found in the veins
in igneous rocks, such as light-colored granites,
gneisses, syenites, etc. While not mined in this
country it is found in small quantities in Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Virginia, Alabama,
Wyoming, Montana, and California.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Titanium</span></h3>
<p>Titanium, as a metal, is a heavy, gray, iron-like
powder, which is chiefly useful as an alloy
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
with iron, giving it toughness, and preventing
bubbles and cracks in casting. It is not as rare as
some other metals which have found a wider use.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Rutile">Rutile</a>
<br />TiO&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_28">Pl. 28</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in tetragonal crystals,
and in grains; hardness 6.5; specific
gravity 4.2; color red to reddish-brown;
streak yellowish-brown; luster metallic
to adamantine; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Rutile usually occurs in crystals, which are
either short and stout, or in needle-like crystals.
Twinning is common. In form and general
appearance it resembles cassiterite, but the
reddish color, and the yellowish-brown streak
will distinguish the rutile. It is found in similar
rocks, granites, gneisses, syenites, and mica-schists,
the two minerals cassiterite and rutile
often occurring together. This is also true of the
grains, which have been weathered out and are
found in sands and gravels of placer deposits.
It is found in small quantities in all the New
England States, New York, and all down the
Appalachian Mountains, especially at Graves
Mountain, Ga., and in Arkansas and Alaska.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Ilmenite">Ilmenite</a>
<br />FeTiO&#8323;</h3>
<p>Occurs in granular masses, as
black sand, or as tabular hexagonal
crystals; hardness 5-6; specific gravity
4.7; color black; streak brownish-red to
black; luster metallic; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<p>When ilmenite occurs in crystals they are
tabular and resemble hematite in its darker
varieties, but the streak readily distinguishes the
two. In masses it looks like magnetite, but the
lack of magnetism serves to distinguish these
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
two minerals. It is very likely to be associated
with cassiterite, rutile, or magnetite in grains
which have weathered out of the original rock,
and have resisted solution and wear. Sands with
a large amount of the above mentioned minerals
are termed &ldquo;black sands,&rdquo; some of which are
important for one or another of these minerals.</p>
<p>Ilmenite is a mineral formed at high temperatures,
and probably often deposited from hot
vapors. It is found in granites, syenites, and
gneisses. Among the better known localities
are Orange, N. Y., Litchfield, Conn., Florida,
California, etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Platinum</span></h3>
<p>This metal is steel-gray in color, very malleable
and ductile, almost infusible and resists the
action of acids. It is one of the &ldquo;noble&rdquo; metals,
much rarer than gold, and so has become popular
for jewelry. It is also used in the manufacture
of sulphuric-acid, in nitrogen-fixation plants, for
chemical utensils, in the electrical industries, and
in dentistry. Platinum in its occurrence is
associated with the certain other equally rare
elements, like iridium, palladium and osmium.
Its use has increased rapidly of late, but the
supply has not kept up with the demand, so
that, whereas in 1906 platinum and gold were
about equally valuable, now the platinum brings
about five times as much as the gold.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Platinum">Platinum</a>
<br />Pt</h3>
<p>Occurs in grains or nuggets;
hardness 4.5; specific gravity 19
(21 if pure); color steel-gray; luster
metallic; opaque.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>This rare metal is mostly found in placer-deposits,
often with gold. It comes originally
from dark igneous rocks, like peridotite, pyroxenite,
etc., and platinum is found to be associated
with the nickel ores of Sudbury, Canada. While
formerly 90% of the world&rsquo;s supply of platinum
came from placer mines in the Ural Mountains,
today more than half is produced in Canada and
about a fifth in Russia. In the United States it
is found in California, Oregon, Nevada, and
Alaska.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Magnesium Group</span></h3>
<p>Magnesium is a silvery-white metal, easily
tarnished by exposure to moist air. Because of
its light weight, less than twice the weight of
water, and strength, it is being substituted for
aluminum, especially in airplanes, where the
question of weight is crucial. It is also used in
automobile and ship production and other machine
industries, and in the manufacture of flares
and incendiary bombs. Magnesium is obtained
chiefly from magnesite, dolomite, and in the
United States as a result of a recently developed
process, from sea water. Magnesium has a
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
considerable number of minerals, of which three
are taken up here and several more under the
head of silicates, where both magnesium and
silicon are combined in a mineral.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Spinel">Spinel</a>
<br />MgAlO&#8324;
<br /><a href="#Plate_29">Pl. 29</a></h3>
<p>Occurs mostly as isometric octahedrons;
hardness 8; specific gravity
3.5; color, red, yellow, green, or
black; streak white; luster vitreous; transparent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>This is a rather rare mineral, but, when in
clear crystals is considered one of the gems. It
was early confused with corundum, and the red
variety called ruby, as it was found in the same
gem-bearing sands in Ceylon, Burma, and Siam.
However the form of the isometric octahedron
as compared with the hexagonal prism of the
corundum, together with the lesser hardness
are sufficient to distinguish the two easily.
The crystals are usually octahedrons, but may
have the corners cut or the edges beveled.
Twins are not uncommon.</p>
<p>The standard color is a clear deep-red, and
such a spinel is known in the gem trade as a
<i>spinel-ruby</i>. If the color is rose-red, it is a
<i>Balas ruby</i>; if orange, it is <i>rubicelle</i>, if of a violet
tinge, <i>almandine</i>. When small quantities of
other elements replace the magnesium, the color
is greatly changed. For example a little iron
present gives the crystals a dark-green to black
color, and the spinel is known as <i>ceylonite</i>. If
there is both iron and chromium present, the
color becomes yellowish or greenish-brown, and
this variety is <i>picotite</i>. When the impurities
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
are iron and copper, the color becomes grass-green,
and it is called <i>chlorospinel</i>. A form, in
which the magnesium is completely replaced by
iron, is black in color and termed <i>hercynite</i>, and
occurs fairly abundantly in Westchester Co.,
N. Y. From Amity, N. Y., to Andover, N. J.,
there is a belt of granular limestone in which
spinel of all colors is found. St. Lawrence Co.,
N. Y., is also a rich locality. Bolton, Mass.,
Newton, Sterling, and Sparta, N. J., North
Carolina, Alabama, and California all yield
spinel.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Magnesite">Magnesite</a>
<br />MgCO&#8323;</h3>
<p>Occurs in cleavable or compact
porcelain-like masses; hardness 4;
specific gravity 3.1; color white to
gray; luster vitreous; translucent on thin
edges.</p>
<p>Magnesite is white and brittle, and cleaves
perfectly parallel to the faces of the rhombohedron,
but it seldom occurs in crystals. It will
effervesce in warm hydrochloric acid and has
some resemblance to calcite, but can be distinguished
by the greater hardness. It is still
more like dolomite, both having the same color
and cleavage, both effervescing in warm hydrochloric
acid; but the magnesite has half a point
greater hardness and the porcelainous appearance.
Magnesite is used in toilet preparations,
paper making, and mixed with asbestos, as a
covering for heating pipes.</p>
<p>Magnesite is found in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania,
Texas, and in large deposits in California
and Washington.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<h3><a id="species_Dolomite">Dolomite</a>
<br />(MgCa)CO&#8323;
<br />Pl. <a href="#Plate_19">19</a> &amp; <a href="#Plate_29">29</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals, or in cleavable
or granular masses; hardness 3.5;
specific gravity 2.8; color white to
pink or gray; streak white; luster vitreous;
transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Dolomite crystallizes in the hexagonal system,
in rhombohedrons (hemihedral form), which are
more or less modified by faces on the corners or
edges. The cleavage is parallel to the rhombohedron,
and it will effervesce in warm hydrochloric
acid. Sometimes the crystal faces are
curved, and when this is the case, dolomite is
easily determined. Usually however dolomite
resembles both calcite and magnesite. From the
calcite it is distinguished by the greater hardness,
and from magnesite by lesser hardness and not
being porcelainous in appearance. Some of the
commoner forms are shown on <a href="#Plate_29">Plate 29</a>, crystals
like C being found embedded in anhydrite and
gypsum.</p>
<p>Magnesium is a common element and is likely
to be present wherever lime is being deposited,
so dolomite crystals are common, and much of
the limestone is dolomitic.</p>
<p>It may be found in almost any limestone
section of the country. Some of the finest
crystals of dolomite however come from Roxbury,
Vt., Smithfield, R. I., Hoboken, N. J.,
Lockport, Rochester, and Niagara Falls, N. Y.,
etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Silicon, Silica and the Silicates</span></h3>
<p>Silicon is one of the non-metallic elements, and
does not occur as such in Nature. When isolated
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
it is either a dark-brown powder, or steel-gray
crystals. However silicon is next to oxygen in
its importance in making the crust of the earth.
Forty-seven per cent of the surface rocks are
composed of oxygen, and 28% of silicon, the
latter appearing in a host of minerals. The
oxide of silicon is termed silica (SiO&#8322;), its crystal
form being quartz, the commonest of all minerals.
In non-crystalline form silica is also widely distributed,
as chalcedony and opal, even appearing
in the tissues of animals and plants, as in the
feathers of birds, the shells of certain Protozoa
(Radiolaria), the spicules of sponges; and in
plants, as the shells of diatoms, and in the stalks
of grasses, especially cereals and bamboo. Silica
in the form of sand is widely used in making
glass, porcelain, china, etc., and in the various
cements.</p>
<p>Then there are a considerable number of acids
of silicon, which do not occur in Nature, but their
salts do, and make a host of minerals, which are
known as the silicates, such as mica, feldspar,
hornblende, etc. Either as quartz, or as
silicates, silicon is represented in most all the
igneous and metamorphic rocks and in many of
the sedimentary rocks.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Quartz">Quartz</a>
<br />SiO&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_30">Pl. 30</a></h3>
<p>Occurs as hexagonal crystals, or
in grains or masses; hardness 7;
specific gravity 2.65; colorless when
pure; luster vitreous; transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Quartz is not hard to identify. Its hardness
and the crystal-form separate it from most all
other minerals. It is the most common mineral,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
making 12% of the earth&rsquo;s crust. The usual
crystal form is a hexagonal prism with the sides
horizontally striated, and a six-sided pyramid on
one or both ends. This six-sided pyramid is
really two rhombohedrons, a right-handed one
and a left-handed one, so that the alternate
faces of the pyramid may show peculiarities, for
instance three may be large and three small, as
in Fig. B, <a href="#Plate_30">Plate 30</a>, or the alternate ones may be
duller or etched in some manner. The crystals
are clear and when pure colorless, but there is a
tendency for some slight impurity to color them
almost any hue.</p>
<p>The most perfect double-ended crystals form
only where growth is possible in all directions,
as in clay. In cavities and caves there is an
opportunity for the crystals to grow in toward
the open spaces, and in such places, one finds
fine large crystals; the Alps, Brazil, Japan, and
Madagascar being especially famous localities.
The largest quartz crystal on record is one 25
feet in circumference which came from Madagascar.
In this country the caves at Little Rock,
Ark., have furnished some very fine large crystals.
Smaller, but very clear crystals, come from about
Herkimer, N. Y. Some of these have been used
as &ldquo;Rhine-stones&rdquo; and as cheap imitations of
diamonds. Clear quartz is beautiful enough to
be a gem, but it is too common to interest people
as jewelry, however many objects of art have
been carved from it. One of these took the form
of crystal balls, which, through the Middle
Ages particularly, developed into a form of
mysticism. The gazing into the crystal ball was
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
supposed to give some people supernatural
vision. It seems to be a form of hypnotism,
gazing at the bright reflecting surface tiring the
eye, and making possible visions, which are
subjective rather than anything external.</p>
<p>Silica is slightly soluble in water, especially
when it is alkaline; so that most river-, lake-, and
sea-waters have some silica in solution, and are
carrying it from one place to another. The
waters, which percolate through the rocks, carry
even more, and when they come out into open
spaces, they give up some of the silica, making
crystals lining these openings, whether fissures or
cavities. Not infrequently these silica-bearing
waters dissolve out some other crystal, and then
deposit in its place silica, thus making a crystal
which has the form of what was dissolved, rather
than that of quartz. Such a form is known as a
pseudomorph.</p>
<p>When molten masses of igneous rock were
cooling the quartz crystals had their faces interfered
with as they grew, and we have resulting
crystalline quartz, simply filling in the spaces
between the other crystals, such as feldspar and
mica, in the granite. Quartz is a large component
in many igneous rocks, also in metamorphic
rocks, and certain sedimentary rocks
like sandstone are almost wholly made up of
quartz grains. Quartz is also the gangue mineral
in many veins. In this case it seems to have been
deposited from hot water or vapors, as they rose
from cooling magmas. With it are associated
all sorts of metallic ores as has been suggested.</p>
<p>Quartz has been largely used to make imitations
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
of other much rarer minerals, sometimes
in its crystalline form to imitate the diamond,
at other times ground and made into a &ldquo;paste,&rdquo;
which is colored to imitate other gems. This
paste is a mixture of about 4 parts of quartz,
5 parts of red lead and 1 part of potassium carbonate,
melted and cooled slowly. It is clear and
has a brilliant luster like the diamond. If some
coloring matter is put into it it can be used for
rubies, sapphires, etc. When there is any reason
to think that this is being used, it is easily
detected by being so much softer than any of the
true gems, and even than true quartz. Quartz
will scratch glass readily, but this imitation has
only the hardness of very soft glass, or about 5.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Varieties of Quartz</span></h3>
<p><b>Rock crystal</b> is the term applied to quartz when
it is clear and colorless.</p>
<p><b>Milky quartz</b> is the milky variety, the whiteness
being due to imperfections in the crystallization,
such as cracks, bubbles, etc.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_SmokyQuartz">Smoky quartz</a></b> is the cloudy brown-colored
variety, which results from the presence of small
quantities of organic matter (hydrocarbons) in
the quartz. If the color is so dark as to be almost
black it is termed <b>morion</b>. In the above cases
the color will disappear if the stone is heated.
Pebbles of smoky quartz from Cairngorm, Scotland,
have been so widely used as semiprecious
stones that they have come to be known as
<b>cairngorms</b>.</p>
<p><b>Citrine</b>, or <b>false topaz</b>, is a clear yellow variety,
the color again due to the presence of organic
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
matter. It is distinguished from true topaz by
the lesser hardness, this having the hardness of
7, while true topaz has a hardness of 8.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Amethyst">Amethyst</a></b> is quartz with a violet color, due to
the presence of small quantities of manganese.
To be suitable for cutting into gems, the color
must be deep or the small pieces will appear almost
colorless. It is widely used today as a
semiprecious stone in jewelry; and in the fifteenth
century it had the traditional virtue of making the
wearer sober-minded, whether he had taken too
freely of wine, or was over excited by love-passion.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_RoseQuartz">Rose quartz</a></b> gets its pale-red color from the
presence of a small amount of titanium. It is
widely distributed, but is more abundant in the
Black Hills of South Dakota.</p>
<p><b>Aventurine</b> is quartz which has inclosed tiny
scales of mica or hematite giving it a spangled
appearance.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Prase">Prase</a></b> is a green quartz, the color being due to the
inclusion of fibrous crystals of green actinolite.</p>
<p><b>Cat&rsquo;s Eye</b> is a quartz which has inclosed silky
fibers of asbestos. When this is cut parallel to
the fibers, the effect is opalescent. The colors
are greenish, yellowish-gray, and brown. This
form, however, is not to be confused with the
true or Oriental Cat&rsquo;s Eye, which is chrysoberyl
and has the hardness of 8.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Chalcedony">Chalcedony</a>
<br />SiO&#8322;</h3>
<p>Non-crystalline, occurring in botryoidal,
stalactitic or concretionary
masses; hardness, 7; specific gravity,
2.65; color white when pure; luster waxy; translucent
to transparent on thin edges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In addition to the crystalline form, silica is
freely deposited in an amorphous or cryptocrystalline
form which has the same properties as
quartz, except the crystal faces. This is called
chalcedony, and it occurs in seams, cavities and
free surfaces. When the surface of a chalcedony
deposit is free it has a waxy luster. It is generally
very brittle and breaks in a peculiar splintery
manner. Like quartz it also has a great
many varieties, according to the impurities present.
Its wide distribution, hardness, and the
manner in which it can be chipped have made
this a most important stone in the history of the
development of civilization. The early men first
broke it into rough tools, such as knives, axes,
spear points, etc., and used these as cutting tools,
of one sort or another, because they held their
edge better than most stones. We apply, to the
people who used only these chipped stones as
tools, the term &ldquo;<i>Men of the Old Stone Age</i>,&rdquo; or the
period is termed the <i>Pal&aelig;olithic Age</i>. Later men
learned how to grind the edge to a smoother
outline, and this much shorter period is termed
the <i>Neolithic Age</i>. The use of flints for the first
tools is world-wide, and the American Indian
when discovered was still using chalcedony in its
rough-hewn state.</p>

<p><b>Chalcedony</b> is the proper term to use when the
color is white to translucent, in which case the
surfaces are usually botryoidal and waxy.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Carnelian">Carnelian</a></b> is chalcedony which is clear red in
color and translucent. This is one of the first
stones used for ornamental purposes and for engraving.
Carnelians with figures engraved on
them were used by the Egyptians, Assyrians
and The Children of Israel, at least 2000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>;
and the Egyptian scarabs of the fifth or sixth
century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, were often carved from this variety
of chalcedony, as well as from jasper and agates.</p>
<p>The brownish varieties are termed <i>sard</i>.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Chrysoprase">Chrysoprase</a></b> is an apple-green variety of
chalcedony the color being due to the presence
of nickel oxide. This is by no means as common
as most of the varieties of chalcedony, and was
long prized as a gem.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Plasma">Plasma</a></b> is chalcedony with a leek- to emerald-green
color, and the same stone when it has small
red spots of jasper in it is termed <i>blood-stone</i>,
or <i>heliotrope</i>. These red spots are said by tradition
to be drops of the blood of Christ.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Jasper">Jasper</a></b> is a deep red chalcedony, the color being
due to hematite, which is so abundant as to make
it opaque. A brown variety colored by limonite
is also called jasper, and even green jaspers are
found. In all cases the opaque character is
common.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Flint">Flint</a></b> is an impure brown chalcedony, usually
forming concretions. The color is due to organic
matter. Flint is mostly found in limestone or
chalk, and the concretions are the result of the
small particles of silica scattered through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
rock being dissolved, and then reprecipitated
about some organic center. Generally the silica
was obtained by the dissolution of small fossils,
like the shells of diatoms or sponge spicules.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Hornstone">Hornstone</a></b> and <b><a id="species_Chert">Chert</a></b> are simply impure varieties
of flint, brown in color, and with a splintery
fracture.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Agate">Agate</a></b>, <a href="#Plate_32">Plate 32</a>, is a banded or cloudy chalcedony
which has formed in a cavity, the layers of
different color representing deposition from
water, carrying first silica with one impurity,
then later, silica with another impurity. Gradually
the cavity has been thus filled with silica;
and when the mass is freed by the weathering
away of the surrounding rock, these banded
masses are found. Sometimes the manner of
deposition has changed, and while the outer part
of the cavity was filled with chalcedony, the
central part will contain quartz crystals. On
account of the beauty of the colors, and the unusual
way in which they may be developed,
agates are widely used for semiprecious jewelry
and objects of art, and this has been true since
ancient times, the name itself coming from the
River Achates in Sicily. The center for cutting
and polishing agates is at Oberstein, Germany,
where this work has been carried on since the
middle of the fifteenth century. In spite of the
many fine natural colors in agates, they are sometimes
artificially colored, in many cases by methods
which are kept as &ldquo;trade secrets.&rdquo; The
color seldom penetrates far; so that even slight
chipping reveals whether an inferior agate has
been taken and colored up, or whether the stone
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
is natural. Moss agates are chalcedony which
has inclosed dendritic masses of some one of the
manganese compounds as shown under manganite,
<a href="#Page_73">p. 73</a>.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_Onyx">Onyx</a></b> is a variety of agate where the bands are
alternately black and white; while <b>sardonyx</b> is
agate with red or brown bands alternating with
the white. Such agates as these are especially
desirable for cameo work, where the figure is
carved in the chalcedony of one color, and the
other color makes the background.</p>
<p><b>Silicified</b> or <i>agatized wood</i> is a form of chalcedony,
where silica has replaced wood, molecule
by molecule; so that in good specimens, all the
structure of the wood is still retained, and when
thin sections are made it can be studied under
the microscope almost as well as modern wood.
This takes place under water, usually, if not always,
in fresh water. Such fossilized wood is
widely distributed in the western United States,
the most famous cases being the Fossil Forest of
Arizona, now a National Reservation, and the
fossil trees in the Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Opal">Opal</a>
<br />SiO&#8322;&middot;H&#8322;O
<br /><a href="#Plate_33">Pl. 33</a></h3>
<p>Non-crystalline, massive, stalactitic
or nodular; hardness, 6; specific
gravity 2; all colors; luster vitreous,
resinous, or pearly; transparent on thin
edges.</p>
<p>Opal differs from chalcedony in having water,
usually about 10%, incorporated in its structure.
This is water of crystallization, and not firmly
held; so that, if opal is heated in a closed tube to
above 100 C., it is given off as a vapor. Opal is
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
distinguished from chalcedony by its lesser hardness,
and the resinous to pearly luster. It forms
in cavities, in layers often of extreme thinness.</p>
<p>Opal is originally the product of the dissolution
of silicate minerals in hot acid waters, the resulting
gelatinous silica, when it is deposited and
hardened, becoming the opal. There are many
varieties, some of them highly prized as gems in
spite of the moderate hardness and opacity of
the mineral. Gem-quality opal gets its opalescent
character from the successive deposition
of thin films of opal, the light penetrating and
being reflected from different films. This breaks
up the white light and causes the play of colors
which is the charm of this gem.</p>
<p><b>Precious opal</b>, in which the play of colors is
finest, comes mostly from Hungary, Mexico, and
Queensland. The opal was a favorite stone from
before Roman times, and in its early history was
a charm against the &ldquo;evil eye.&rdquo; During the
nineteenth century for some reason it came to be
considered an unlucky stone.</p>
<p><b><a id="species_FireOpal">Fire opal</a></b> is a hyacinth-red to honey-yellow
variety, which has a fire-like play of color, and
is found in Mexico and Honduras.</p>
<p><b>Common opal</b> does not have the play of color,
but comes in a variety of colors; is waxy or greasy
in luster; and occurs mostly as fillings of seams or
cavities, especially those in igneous rocks, like
the steam holes in lavas, etc. It is found in
Cornwall, Penn., in Colorado, California, etc.</p>
<p><b>Opal-agate</b> is a variety in which there are
color bands, and it is widely distributed.</p>
<p><b>Opalized wood</b> is formed in exactly the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
manner as agatized wood, much of the fossil wood
called silicified being really opalized.</p>
<p><b>Siliceous sinter</b> is the porous mass of opal
which is so frequently deposited about hot
springs and geysers. It is readily recognized by
its porous character.</p>
<p>The shells of the diatoms, which are microscopic
plants, are made of opal; and while they
are so small, there is certainly no other plant so
abundant or omnipresent, living as it does in
every pool, lake, or sea by the millions. These
shells are very indestructible so that they
accumulate at the bottom of ponds, bogs, and
sea-bottoms, making at times extensive deposits.
This material in quantities is termed diatomaceous
earth, or <b>tripolite</b> (from Tripoli where it was
first used commercially). It is used as a polishing
powder for metals, marble, glasses, etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span id="species_Feldspar" class="sc">The Feldspars</span></h3>
<p>The term feldspar is a family name for a large
variety of very common minerals, which altogether
make up nearly 60% of the crust of the
earth, being the predominant part of granites,
gneisses, and lavas. In composition they are
silicates of aluminum, together with potassium,
sodium and calcium, and their mixtures. They
may be tabulated as follows:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. KAlSi&#8323;O&#8328;, <i>orthoclase</i>, the silicate of aluminum and potassium.</dt>
<dt>2. NaAlSi&#8323;O&#8328;, <i>albite</i>, the silicate of aluminum and sodium.</dt>
<dt>3. CaAlSi&#8322;O&#8328;, <i>anorthite</i>, the silicate of aluminum and calcium.</dt>
<dt>4. Mixtures of 1 and 2 are <i>alkalic feldspar</i>.</dt>
<dt>5. Mixtures of 2 and 3 are <i>plagioclase feldspar</i>.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Orthoclase is monoclinic, but the rest of the
feldspars are triclinic. If crystals are available
they may be short and stout, or tabular and thin,
but as the feldspars are mostly components of the
igneous rocks, where perfect crystals have not
had a chance to grow, they are mostly determined
by their hardness and cleavage. The hardness
of all the feldspars is 6 or very close to it.</p>
<p>They all have three planes of cleavage, two of
which are good and intersect either at 90&deg; as in
orthoclase, or at about 86&deg; as in the plagioclase
series; while the third cleavage plane is imperfect.
In figure 1, <a href="#Plate_34">Plate 34</a>, a and b are the two perfect
cleavages, while c is the imperfect one. Breaking
into such cleavage masses as the one illustrated
is characteristic of feldspar. The specific gravity
ranges from 2.55 to 2.75. The luster is vitreous,
and the color white, ranging to various shades
of gray and pink, and, sometimes in recent lavas,
colorless.</p>
<p>Twinning is very common and helps to distinguish
orthoclase from the plagioclase feldspars.
In orthoclase the twins are simple, that is, only
two crystals growing together, and are united
on one of the faces, as if one of them had been
revolved 180&deg; with the other; or, while related to
each other as in the preceding case, they may
seem to grow through each other. On <a href="#Plate_34">plate 34</a>
are three orthoclase crystals showing this simple
type of twinning. The first (A) is a simple crystal;
the second (B) shows the simplest type of twinning
where the left-hand crystal has revolved
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
180&deg; on the p face, and the end is composed, half
of the upper end of one crystal, and half of the
lower end of the adjacent crystal. The presence
of re&euml;ntrant angles calls attention to the twinning.
The third figure (C) is a case of intergrowing
crystals.</p>
<p>In the plagioclase feldspars twinning is multiple,
a large number of crystals, each thin,
sometimes as thin as paper, growing side by side,
the first one in normal position, the next at 180&deg;
with it, the third revolved 180&deg; to the second and
thus parallel to the first, and so on. The result
is first of all a striated appearance, and second
that, as plagioclase crystals have their prism
faces intersecting at 86&deg;, there is a series of low
roofs and valleys, which are best seen by holding
the piece of feldspar so the light reflects from a
cleavage face, when it will appear striated; then
by tilting it about 8 degrees a second set of reflections,
also appearing striated, will appear.
The light was first reflected from one side of the
roofs, and in the second case from the other
side. Figure D, <a href="#Plate_34">Pl. 34</a>, is a diagram showing the
relation of the individual crystals in a multiple
twinned piece of plagioclase, in which the crystals
are represented as rather large. <a href="#Plate_35">Plate 35</a>,
under labradorite, shows a photograph of a cleavage
piece, on which is readily seen the striation
which is characteristic of the plagioclase feldspars.</p>
<p>Mixtures of albite and anorthite occur in bewildering
numbers, one or the other predominating,
and each mixture being uniform throughout
the crystal and in the whole mass; so each combination
is a mineral, each with its special properties;
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
but the different plagioclase feldspars are
so similar in appearance, that by the naked eye
it is impossible to separate the closely related
ones. This can be done under the microscope by
studying the angles at which light is cut off, and
also by chemical analyses. For our purposes six
types will suffice to illustrate the group, and their
composition may be indicated as follows.</p>
<p>Albite is albite with up to 15% of anorthite
mixed with it.</p>
<p>Oligoclase is albite with from 15-25% of
anorthite mixed with it.</p>
<p>Andesite is albite with from 25-50% of anorthite
mixed with it.</p>
<p>Labradorite is anorthite with from 25-50%
of albite mixed with it.</p>
<p>Bytownite is anorthite with from 15-25% of
albite mixed with it.</p>
<p>Anorthite is anorthite with up to 15% of
albite mixed with it.</p>
<p>The best method for distinguishing these
feldspars of the plagioclase group is to measure
the angle between the two perfect cleavage faces,
and even this requires careful measurement. The
angles between these faces are as follows:</p>

<h3><a id="species_Orthoclase">Orthoclase</a>

<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
perfect and at 90&deg;, in the third direction
imperfect; luster vitreous; translucent on thin
edges.</p>
<p>Orthoclase is monoclinic, and when formed in
cavities develops as crystals, but it is usually a
constituent of igneous rocks, in which case the
crystals have not had the opportunity to develop
the crystal faces, and the orthoclase is in grains
or irregular masses; and the best way of determining
the mineral is the cleavage, the two
perfect cleavage planes intersecting at right
angles. Twinning is frequent but of the simple
type, only two crystals being united, similar to
either B or C on <a href="#Plate_34">plate 34</a>.</p>
<p>It is found in granites, gneisses or lavas, wherever
they occur, being especially characteristic
of the granites of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Microcline">Microcline</a>
<br />KAlSi&#8323;O&#8328;
<br /><a href="#Plate_35">Pl. 35</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in granites and gneisses
as crystals or irregular masses; hardness,
6; specific gravity, 2.56; color
white to gray, pink, or greenish; luster vitreous;
translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Microcline has the same composition as orthoclase,
but is in the triclinic system, the c axis
being inclined a half degree away from a right
angle with the b axis. This is best seen in the
cleavage pieces, the two perfect cleavage planes
meeting at 89&deg; 30&prime;, and this is the only test for
determining this mineral by the unaided eye.
Pike&rsquo;s Peak is the best known locality for microcline,
and there it occurs in fine large crystals
of greenish color, which are known as <i>Amazon
stone</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h3><a id="species_Albite">Albite</a>
<br />NaAlSi&#8323;O&#8328;</h3>
<p>Occurs in small crystals, or more
often in lamellar masses in granites
or in seams in metamorphic rocks;
hardness, 6; specific gravity, 2.62; color white to
gray; luster vitreous.</p>
<p>Albite may occur in simple crystals, in which
case the two perfect cleavage planes meet at an
angle of 86&deg; 24&prime;. However, it is much more
frequently found twinned in the multiple manner,
the individual crystals often being as thin as
paper. This gives rise to a fine striation on the
end of a crystal, or on the surface made by the
imperfect cleavage plane. Where the crystals
are extremely thin, the surface may have a pearly
luster. Albite types of granite often inclose
secondary minerals, that are prized as gems, such
as topaz, tourmaline, and beryl.</p>
<p>It is found at Paris, Me., Chesterfield, Mass.,
Acworth, N. H., Essex Co., N. Y., Unionville,
Penn., and in Virginia, and throughout the
Rocky Mountains.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Oligoclase">Oligoclase</a>
<br />(NaCa)AlSi&#8323;O&#8328;</h3>
<p>Generally found in cleavable
masses in granites and lavas, rarely
in crystals; hardness, 6; specific
gravity, 2.65; color white, greenish or pink; luster
vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Oligoclase is a plagioclase feldspar and is distinguished
by its two perfect cleavage planes
meeting at an angle of 86&deg; 32&prime;, but otherwise it is
very like albite. Crystals are not common, and
it occurs mostly in masses, making one of the
components of granite or lava.</p>
<p>It is found in St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., Danbury
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
and Haddam, Conn., Chester, Mass.,
Unionville, Penn., Bakersville, N. C., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Labradorite">Labradorite</a>
<br />(NaCa)AlSi&#8323;O&#8328;
<br /><a href="#Plate_35">Pl. 35</a></h3>
<p>Usually found in cleavable masses
in granites and lavas; hardness, 6;
specific gravity, 2.71; color gray or
white, often with a play of colors;
luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Labradorite is distinguished by having the two
perfect cleavage planes meet at 86&deg; 14&prime;. The
iridescent play of color is also very characteristic
and is generally present. It is due to the
inclusion of minute impurities. This feldspar
is usually associated with granites or lavas in
which the dark minerals predominate. It gets
its name from being the feldspar of the granites
of Labrador, and is also found in the granites of
the central part of the Adirondack Mountains
and the Wichita Mountains of Arkansas.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The <a id="species_Pyroxene">Pyroxene</a> Group</span></h3>
<p>The minerals of this group are generally associated
with feldspars, and make the dark-colored
component of granites, gneisses and
lavas. This is especially true of those which
have some iron in the crystal. Pyroxenes are
salts of metasilicic acid (H&#8322;SiO&#8323;), in which the
hydrogen (H) has been replaced by calcium,
magnesium, iron, etc. The commoner minerals
are orthorhombic or monoclinic, and all agree in
their crystal habit, being short stout prisms, with
the vertical edges so beveled that a cross section
is eight-sided. The cleavage is good in two directions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
parallel to the beveling faces (m in figure
b, <a href="#Plate_36">Plate 36</a>), and they intersect at an angle of
87&deg;. This is very characteristic, and if one has a
crystal broken across, it is easy to see and measure
this angle of intersection. These pyroxenes
have the same chemical composition as the corresponding
series of amphiboles, but the two are
distinguished by several features. Pyroxenes
are short and stout crystals, while amphiboles
are long and either blade- or needle-like; pyroxenes
are eight-sided in cross section, while
amphiboles are six-sided; in pyroxenes the cleavage
planes intersect at 87&deg;, while in amphiboles
they intersect at 55&deg;. The minerals of this group
are most frequently one of the components of a
lava or granite, and are less frequently associated
with metamorphic rocks. Three are common;
enstatite, hypersthene, and augite.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Enstatite">Enstatite</a>
<br />MgSiO&#8323;</h3>
<p>Usually occurs in lamellar or fibrous-lamellar
masses in dark lavas;
hardness, 5.5; specific gravity, 3.3;
color gray, bronze or brown; luster vitreous,
translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Enstatite rarely occurs in crystals, but when it
does they are orthorhombic. Usually it is in irregular
masses with the cleavage angles, typical
of pyroxene. The color is light, that is gray or
brownish, and the streak white or nearly so. In
most respects it is similar to hypersthene, which
has the same composition, except that a large
part of the magnesium is replaced by iron, and
there are all sorts of gradations between the two
minerals. When some iron takes the place of
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
magnesium, the color darkens to, or towards
bronze, until when about a third of the magnesium
is so replaced, and the color is fully bronze,
this variety is called <i>bronzite</i>. Bronzite is present
in some of the dark lavas like gabbro and
peridotite. Enstatite is found in the Adirondack
Mountains, at Brewster and Edwards, N. Y., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Hypersthene">Hypersthene</a>
<br />(MgFe)SiO&#8323;</h3>
<p>Occurs in cleavable masses in
dark lavas; hardness, 5.5; specific
gravity, 3.4; color dark-brown or
greenish-brown; luster vitreous; translucent on
thin edges.</p>
<p>Hypersthene is a pyroxene in which magnesium
and iron are present in about equal quantities.
It is similar to enstatite, except that the
color is darker, and the streak gray or brownish-gray
in color. These two minerals grade into
each other, so that there are cases where it is
simply a matter of preference as to which name
should be given to the mineral. This form is
associated with dark lavas, of the gabbro or
peridotite type, in such places as the Adirondack
Mountains, Mount Shasta in California, Buffalo
Peaks, Colo., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Augite">Augite</a>
<br />CaMg(SiO&#8323;)&#8322;, MgAlSiO&#8326; + Fe&#8322;O&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_36">Pl. 36</a></h3>
<p>Usually occurs in short stout
monoclinic crystals; hardness, 5.5;
specific gravity, 3.3; color dark-green
to black; luster vitreous;
translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Augite is a complex pyroxene having some iron
and aluminum always present in it, but the
amount not a fixed quantity. It is by far the
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
commonest of the pyroxenes and has a wide distribution,
both in the sorts of lavas in which it
appears, and in the world. It is commonly
the dark component of such lavas, as gabbros and
peridotites, and also is common in metamorphic
rocks, especially impure crystalline limestones.
It is found at Raymond and Mumford, Me.,
Thetford, Vt., Canaan, Conn., in Westchester,
Orange, Lewis and St. Lawrence Counties of N.
Y., in Chester Co., Penn., at Ducktown, Tenn.,
Templeton, Canada, etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The <a id="species_Amphibole">Amphibole</a> Group</span></h3>
<p>The amphiboles are a group of minerals made
up of the same chemical elements as the pyroxenes,
but with the molecular arrangement different,
which appears in the forms of the crystals.
The commoner ones are all monoclinic but contrast
with the pyroxenes as follows. Amphiboles
are long and slender crystals, while pyroxenes
are short and stout; amphiboles are six-sided,
while pyroxenes are eight-sided; amphiboles
have the two perfect cleavages intersecting at
55&deg; and 125&deg;, while those of pyroxene intersect
at 87&deg; and 93&deg;. With the above in mind it is
easy to place the minerals in their proper group,
but inside the group it is not always so easy to
distinguish one from another. This group is
associated rather with metamorphic rocks than
with igneous rocks, with which the pyroxenes are
mostly associated. The three commoner minerals
of the group are tremolite, actinolite, and
hornblende.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h3><a id="species_Tremolite">Tremolite</a>
<br />(CaMg)&#8323;(SiO&#8323;)&#8324;
<br /><a href="#Plate_37">Pl. 37</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in long prismatic crystals
or in columnar or fibrous masses;
hardness 5.5; specific gravity, 3;
color white to gray; luster vitreous; transparent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>The long prismatic crystals of tremolite occur
especially where dolomitic limestones have been
altered by metamorphism. Sometimes these
crystals grow side by side, making fibrous masses,
where the long slender crystals can be picked
apart with the fingers, and yet are flexible, and
tough enough so that they can be felted together.
This is termed asbestos, which, because it is
infusible and a poor conductor of heat, is much
used to make insulators, fire-proof shingles, and
all sorts of fireproof materials. The varieties in
which the crystals are finer and silky in appearance,
like the one illustrated on <a href="#Plate_38">Plate 38</a> are
termed <i>amianthus</i>. There are other minerals,
such as actinolite and serpentine, which occur in
the same manner, and are also called asbestos, the
serpentine variety being just now the most important
commercially.</p>
<p>Tremolite is found at Lee, Mass., Canaan,
Conn., Byram, N. J., in Georgia, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Actinolite">Actinolite</a>
<br />(CaMgFe)&#8323;(SiO&#8323;)&#8324;</h3>
<p>Occurs in radiating crystals, or
in fibrous masses; hardness, 5.5;
specific gravity 3; color pale- to dark-green;
luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Except for its green color, this mineral is very
like tremolite. The difference between the two is
due to the small amount of iron in the actinolite.
It is usually found in schists, and the radiating
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
character of the crystal groups is enough to
determine the mineral, if it is already clear that
it is one of the amphiboles. Occasionally it occurs
with the crystals parallel to each other, making
one of the forms of asbestos.</p>
<p>Actinolite is found at Warwick, Edenville, and
Amity in Orange Co., N. Y., at Franklin and
Newton, N. J., Mineral Hill and Unionville,
Penn., Bare Hills, Md., Willis Mt., Va., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Hornblende">Hornblende</a>
<br />(CaMgFe)&#8323;(SiO&#8323;)&#8324;CaMgAl&#8322;(SiO&#8324;)&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_37">Pl. 37</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in well-defined crystals, in
grains and in masses; hardness, 5.5;
specific gravity 3.2; color black,
dark-green, or dark-brown; luster
vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>In composition hornblende corresponds to
augite, but occurs in long slender, six-sided
crystals with cleavage planes intersecting at 55&deg;,
so that it is a typical amphibole. It occurs in a
very wide range of rocks, such as granite, syenite,
diabase, and gabbro; and in such metamorphic
rocks as schists and gneisses; and sometimes
igneous rocks are made up almost entirely of
hornblende, when they are known as amphibolites
or hornblendite. It is found all through the
New England States, down along the Piedmont
Plateau, through the Blue Ridge Mountains,
and in many of the western mountainous areas.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The <a id="species_Garnet">Garnet</a> Group</span></h3>
<p>The garnets are a series of double silicates,
which occur with surprisingly uniform characters.
They are all isometric, and occur either
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
as dodecahedrons, or as the 24-sided figure (the
trapezohedron), which is formed by the beveling
of the edges of the dodecahedron, and developing
these new faces to the exclusion of the dodecahedron
faces. Combinations of the dodecahedron
and trapezohedron (36 faces) may occur. All
the garnets have a hardness of 7 to 7.5, and the
specific gravity runs from 3.2 to 4.3, according to
the composition. In size they run from as small
as a grain of sand up to as large as a boy&rsquo;s marble,
and occasionally even to four inches in diameter.
The color varies with the composition, from colorless
to yellow, red, violet, or green. There is no
cleavage, and the luster is always vitreous.</p>
<p>Garnets are usually accessory minerals, found
in metamorphic rocks, though they are sometimes
also present in granites and lavas. They are
always segregations which have taken place in
the presence of high temperatures. When clear
and perfect several of the garnets are used as
gems. On the other hand some of the common
garnets occur in such quantities that they are
crushed and used as abrasives, for such work
as dental polishes, or for leather and wood
polishing.</p>
<p>The following is the composition of some of the
commoner garnets.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p><b>Grossularite</b> is chiefly found in crystalline
limestones, which have resulted either from
contact with lavas, or from general metamorphism
of impure limestones. These garnets are
colorless to white, or more often shades of yellow,
orange, pink, green or brown, according to traces
of impurity which they may contain. The
cinnamon-colored variety from Ceylon is termed
<i>cinnamon stone</i>, and is a fairly popular gem.</p>
<p><b>Pyrope</b> is a deep-red color and when perfect
is highly prized as a gem. It is found in dark-colored
igneous rocks, like lavas, or serpentines.
Some of the finest come from South Africa, where
they are found in company with the diamond.</p>
<p><b>Almandite</b> is dark-red to brown in color, the
brownish-cast distinguishing it from pyrope.
It is one of the garnets known as &ldquo;common garnet.&rdquo;
In some cases it is clear and deep colored
enough to be used as a gem, but mostly it is
muddy in appearance. The name almandite
comes from Alabanda, a city of the ancient district
of Caria, Asia Minor, whence garnets were
traded to ancient Rome. The finest garnets
&ldquo;Sirian garnets&rdquo; came from the city of &ldquo;Sirian&rdquo;
in Lower Burma, and were supposed to have been
found near there, but careful investigation shows
that no garnets occurred near there, and this
town was therefore, even at that early time, a
distributing point for garnets, found probably
further to the east. The &ldquo;Sirian&rdquo; garnet had a
violet cast and now the term is used to indicate a
type of garnet, rather than a locality.</p>
<p><b>Spessartite</b> is dark-hyacinth-red, or red with a
violet-tinge, and is one of the less-common garnets.
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
It is usually found in granites. The finest
garnets of the type come from Amelia Court
House, Va., which has yielded some ranging
from one up to a hundred carats.</p>
<p><b>Andradite</b> is another garnet which is termed
&ldquo;common garnet.&rdquo; It is red in color, but with a
yellowish-cast which distinguishes it from almandite,
but these two are not easy to separate.
It is found mostly in metamorphosed limestones.
One variety is black in color and called <i>malanite</i>.
It is found in lavas. The common yellowish-red
garnets are found through New England and the
Piedmont Plateau.</p>
<p><b>Uvarovite</b> is a rare garnet of emerald-green
color, found in association with chromium ores.</p>
<p>The number of localities for garnets is so great
that a list would suggest most of the regions
where metamorphic rocks occur, as all over New
England, throughout the Piedmont Plateau, the
Rocky Mountains, etc. Certain fine clear garnets,
found in Montana, northeastern Arizona, and
northwestern New Mexico are sold under the
trade name of &ldquo;Montana, Arizona or New
Mexico rubies.&rdquo; These are of fine quality and
are mostly collected by the Indians from the ant
hills and scorpion&rsquo;s nests of those regions.</p>
<p>Garnets are among the earliest stones mentioned
in ancient languages, as would be expected
from the way these hard and beautiful
crystals weather out of the much softer metamorphic
rocks, like schists. In the past they,
with most any other translucent red stone, were
included under the name <i>carbuncle</i>. This, however,
is not the name of any mineral, but refers
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
rather to a mode of cutting, <i>en cabochon</i> or with
a convex surface.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Glucinum</span></h3>
<p>Glucinum is a rare metal, silvery-white in
color, malleable, and melting at a fairly low
temperature. It is found in the mineral beryl,
from which has come the alternative name <i>beryllium</i>.
The name comes from the sweet taste of
its salts. Except for beryl its minerals are rare,
and the metal has found but few uses for man.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Beryl">Beryl</a>
<br />Gl&#8323;Al&#8322;(SiO&#8323;)&#8326;
<br /><a href="#Plate_39">Pl. 39</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in hexagonal crystals in
granites, gneisses and mica schists;
hardness, 7.5; specific gravity, 2.7;
color usually some tint of green; luster vitreous;
transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>When this mineral occurs in coarse hexagonal
prisms, with or without faces on the ends, it is
known as beryl; when the crystals are clear and
perfect and of a dark-green color, they are of gem
value and are termed <i>emerald</i>; when of a light-green
color, they are <i>aquamarine</i>; and when
bright-yellow in color, they are the <i>golden beryl</i>.
There is little difficulty in determining beryl, for
only apatite occurs in such crystals, and is green,
and this latter mineral has a hardness of only 5.
There is an imperfect basal cleavage.</p>
<p>Ordinary beryl is fairly common in granites of
the pegmatite sort, and less common in gneisses
and mica-schists. This type often furnishes
crystals of large size, up to two and three feet in
diameter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Beryl which is free from cracks and inclosures,
so it can be used as a gem, is so rare, that the
emerald has a value above that of the diamond,
and second only to the ruby. It is one of the
gems with a long history, having been quarried
on the west coast of the Red Sea at least 1650
<span class="small">B.C.</span> by the Egyptians. To early people it had a
power to quicken the prophet instinct and made
the wearer see more clearly. The Spanish conquistadores
found fine emeralds among the treasures
of both Mexico and Peru. In the United
States, Stony Point, N. C., was a notable locality
for these gems, but now seems to have been exhausted.
The name emerald has been applied to
many other green stones, usually with some geographical
modification, as &ldquo;Oriental emerald&rdquo;
which is green corundum, &ldquo;Brazilian emerald&rdquo;
which is tourmaline, etc.</p>
<p>Giant beryls have been found at Acworth and
Grafton, N. H., and at Royalston, Mass. Localities
for ordinary beryl are Albany, Norway,
Bethel, Hebron, Paris, and Topsham, Me., Barre,
Goshen and Chesterfield, Mass., New Milford
and Branchville, Conn., Chester and Mineral
Hill, Penn., Stony Point, N. C., and many other
localities in the Appalachians; also Mount
Antero, Colo., and in the Black Hills of South
Dakota.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Sodalite">Sodalite</a>
<br />Na&#8324;Al&#8323;Cl(SiO&#8324;)&#8323;</h3>
<p>Occurs in irregular masses, sometimes
in dodecahedrons; hardness,
5.5-6; specific gravity, 2.3; color
deep-blue to colorless; streak white; luster vitreous;
translucent on thin edges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>This striking mineral, with its deep-blue to
azure color, is not easily confused with any other.
It is characteristic of soda-rich igneous rocks
such as syenite and some lavas. In this country
it is found at Litchfield, Me., and Salem, Mass.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Zircon">Zircon</a>
<br />ZrSiO&#8324;
<br /><a href="#Plate_39">Pl. 39</a></h3>
<p>Usually occurs in tetrahedral crystals
in igneous rocks; hardness, 7.5;
specific gravity, 4.7; color brown;
luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Zircon, the mineral of the rare earth element
zirconium, nearly always occurs in light-colored
igneous rocks, like syenite. It may occur in
schists or gneisses, but in these rocks the crystals
are of microscopic size. Because of their great
hardness and insolubility, zircon crystals resist
weathering and are often found, along with gold,
cassiterite, or magnetite, in sands which have
resulted from the disintegration of syenite rocks.</p>
<p>Zircon refracts and disperses light to a degree
second only to the diamond, so that clear crystals
are sought as gems. They are often called &ldquo;Matura
diamonds&rdquo; because of their abundance
at Matura, Ceylon. When the crystals are
colorless or smoky they are termed <i>jargons</i> or
<i>jargoons</i>; when of a red-orange hue, they are
<i>hyacinth</i> or <i>jacinth</i>. Most of the zircon of gem-quality
comes from Ceylon, where it is picked up
as rolled-pebbles from the beds of brooks.</p>
<p>The most remarkable American locality for
zircon is near Green River, in Henderson Co.,
N. C., where it is found abundantly in a decomposed
pegmatite dike, from which many tons
have been obtained. It is also found at Moriah,
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
Warwick, Amity and Diana, N. Y., at Franklin
Furnace, and Trenton, N. J., in the gold-bearing
sands of California, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Cyanite">Cyanite</a>
<br />Al&#8322;SiO&#8325;
<br /><a href="#Plate_40">Pl. 40</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in long blade-like crystals
in gneisses and schists; hardness, 7
at right angles to the length, and
4.5 parallel to the length; specific gravity, 3.6;
color blue; luster vitreous; translucent on thin
edges.</p>
<p>There are only a few blue minerals, and the
way in which cyanite occurs in long thin blade-like
crystals is entirely characteristic. If more
is still wanted to determine this mineral, its
unique character in having the great hardness 7
when scratched parallel to the length, and only
4.5 when scratched crossways, will settle any
doubts.</p>
<p>The mineral <i>sillimanite</i> has the same composition
as cyanite, but is fibrous in habit and has the
hardness 6.5. If cyanite is heated to 1350&deg; C.
it changes its character and becomes sillimanite.</p>
<p>Cyanite is found as an accessory mineral in
metamorphic rocks, such as gneiss and schist, at
Chesterfield, Mass., Litchfield and Oxford, Conn.,
in Chester Co., Penn., in North Carolina, etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The <a id="species_Mica">Mica</a> Group</span></h3>
<p>The micas are very common minerals, easily
recognized by their very perfect basal cleavage,
as a result of which thin sheets, often less than a
thousandth of an inch in thickness, readily split
off. These are tough and elastic, which distinguishes
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
mica from the chlorite group in which
there is similar basal cleavage, but the sheets are
not elastic.</p>
<p>Micas are complex silicates of aluminum, with
potassium, iron, lithium, magnesium and hydrogen.
They are one of the principle components
of many granites, gneisses, and schists. This
mineral is always crystalline, being in the monoclinic
system, but occurring in six-sided prisms.
The cleavage is so dominant a character that the
crystal form is usually overlooked, as it is seldom
requisite in determining this mineral. The size
of the sheets of mica depend on the size of the
crystals, the larger sheets expressing great slowness
in cooling from the original magmas. Sometimes
the crystals may be two or even three feet
in diameter. The hardness is not great, ranging
between 2 and 3. The specific gravity lies between
2.7 and 3.2. The color varies according to
the composition, from silvery-white, through
gray, pink, and green to black. The luster is
vitreous to pearly, sometimes gleaming in the
darker-colored varieties. The commoner types
of mica are as follows:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Muscovite, H&#8322;KAl&#8323;(SiO&#8324;)&#8323; or potash mica.</dt>
<dt>Lepidolite, LiK(Al&#8322;OH&middot;F)Al(SiO&#8323;)&#8323; or lithia mica.</dt>
<dt>Biotite, (HK)&#8322;(MgFe)&#8322;Al&#8322;(SiO&#8324;)&#8323; or iron mica.</dt>
<dt>Phlogopite, H&#8322;KMg&#8323;Al(SiO&#8328;)&#8323; or magnesia mica.</dt></dl>
<p><b>Muscovite</b> is colorless, silvery-white, gray or
sometimes pale-green or brown. It gets its name
from Moscow where it was early used for window
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
panes, and it is still used for stove and furnace
doors, as well as in electric work, for a lubricant,
etc.</p>
<p>The best crystals occur in granites, in the
coarse varieties of which large crystals may be
obtained. It is found also as small scales in
gneisses and schists, and when weathered from
its original rocks it may be present in sandstones
and shales. Muscovite is always in its origin an
elementary component of deep-seated igneous
rocks, like granite; but is never a component of
extruded lavas. <i>Sericite</i> is muscovite which has
been secondarily produced by the alteration of
other minerals into muscovite, as when feldspar,
cyanite, topaz, etc., have been modified by the
presence of heat and hot vapors, when near lavas
that have come in contact with other rocks.
Muscovite is very resistant to alteration by
weathering, but when it does change, the greater
part of it becomes kaolin. It is found at Acworth
and Grafton, N. H., in plates, sometimes a yard
across at Paris, Me., Chesterfield and Goshen,
Mass., Portland and Middletown, Conn., at
Warwick, Edenville, etc., N. Y., and all down the
Appalachian Mts., also in the Rocky Mts., the
Cascade Range, etc.</p>
<p><b>Lepidolite</b> is pink or lilac in color and occurs in
scaly masses, mostly in granites. It does not
come in large crystals. Lepidolite is found
at Paris and Hebron, Me., Middletown, Conn.,
Pala, Calif., etc.</p>
<p><b>Biotite</b> is dark-brown or black mica. Like
muscovite it is very common, making one of the
chief components of granites, gneisses and schists;
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
and, unlike muscovite, it may occur in extrusive
lavas, like trachyte, andesite, and basalt. It
resists weathering much less than muscovite, so
that, when the rocks of which it is a component
disintegrate, biotite is usually altered to kaolin
and other compounds. It is likely to occur in
good-sized crystals, especially at Topsam, Me.,
Moriah, N. Y., Easton, Penn., etc.</p>
<p><b>Phlogopite</b> is pale-brown, often coppery in
color, and is most likely to occur in serpentines,
or crystalline limestones or dolomites, often in
fine crystals, of good size. While one of the less
abundant micas, this is found at Gouverneur,
Edwards, and Warwick, N. Y., Newton, N. J.,
and Burgess, Canada.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Topaz">Topaz</a>
<br />Al&#8322;F&#8322;SiO&#8324;
<br /><a href="#Plate_41">Pl. 41</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals mostly; hardness,
8; specific gravity, 3.5; colorless
to pale-yellow; luster vitreous;
transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Topaz may be colorless, but is more often some
shade of yellow, and at times brown or even blue.
Its hardness is characteristic, there being but few
minerals as hard, and it is used to represent the
hardness 8 in the Moh&rsquo;s scale. The crystals are
orthorhombic prisms, with the edges of the
prism beveled and often striated. The ends of
crystals usually terminate with a basal plane,
parallel to which there is good cleavage. Between
this basal plane and the prism faces there
are usually several sets of small faces as indicated
on <a href="#Plate_41">Plate 41</a>.</p>
<p>This mineral, as is also true of most minerals
containing fluorine, is one of those which have
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
crystallized out from hot vapors, escaping from
igneous magmas. It is associated with such
minerals, as tourmaline, beryl, fluorite, and cassiterite,
and occurs mostly in cavities or seams,
in or near granites.</p>
<p>Ordinary topaz, which means crystals that are
imperfect by reason of tiny cracks and impurities
is not very rare, but crystals which are perfect
and clear in color are considered gems. Most of
the gem-topaz is some shade of yellow, but may
be brown or blue, never, however, pink, as is often
seen in jewelry. The &ldquo;pinking&rdquo; is artificial, and
done by packing yellow or brown topaz in magnesia,
asbestos, or lime, and then heating it
slowly to red heat, after which it is cooled slowly.
If underheated the color is salmon, if overheated
all color disappears. Topaz has been a gem for
centuries, the earliest records coming from Egypt.
The name comes from <i>topazios</i>, meaning to seek,
because the earliest known locality, from which
it was gathered, was a little island of that name
in the Red Sea, and this island was often surrounded
by fog and hard for those early mariners
to find. Here by mandate of the Egyptian kings
the inhabitants had to collect topazes, and deliver
them to the gem-cutters of Egypt for polishing.</p>
<p>Several yellow stones are called topaz, as the
&ldquo;Oriental topaz&rdquo; which is corundum and more
valuable than topaz itself; and several varieties of
yellow quartz, which go under such names as
&ldquo;Saxon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Scotch,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spanish,&rdquo; and &ldquo;smoky&rdquo;
topaz. When topaz occurs colorless as in Siberia,
the Ural Mountains, and in the state of Minas
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
Geraes, Brazil, in all of which places it is found
as pebbles in brooks, it goes under the name of
&ldquo;slave&rsquo;s diamonds.&rdquo; Brazil is today the chief
source of gem-quality topaz.</p>
<p>Ordinary topaz is found in this country at
Trumbull, Conn., Crowder&rsquo;s Mt., N. C., Thomas
Mts., Utah, in Colorado, Missouri, and California,
etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Staurolite">Staurolite</a>
<br />FeAl&#8325;OH(SiO&#8326;)&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_41">Pl. 41</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in orthorhombic crystals;
hardness, 7.5; specific gravity, 3.7;
color brown; luster resinous; translucent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>This mineral occurs about equally abundantly
in simple crystals similar to the outline on <a href="#Plate_41">Plate 41</a>,
and in twins which have grown through each
other either at 90&deg; or at 60&deg;. The color is either
brown or reddish-brown. In all cases it is an
accessory mineral, occurring in metamorphic
rocks, usually schists, though less frequently
in slates and gneisses.</p>
<p>From the seventeenth century on, it has been
used as a baptismal stone, and worn as a charm,
legends stating that it fell from the heavens.
Fine crystals have been found in Patrick County,
Va., and there is in this region the legend, that
when the fairies heard of the crucifixion of Christ,
they wept and their tears falling crystallized in
the form of crosses, such as the one shown on
<a href="#Plate_41">Plate 41</a>.</p>
<p>Staurolite is found in the schists of New England
as at Windham, Me., or Chesterfield, Mass.,
and all down the east side of the Appalachian
Mountains to Georgia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<h3><a id="species_Olivine">Olivine</a>
<br />(MgFe)&#8322;SiO&#8324;
<br /><i>Peridot</i> or <i>Chrysolite</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in grains and irregular
masses in dark lavas; hardness 6.5
to 7; specific gravity 3.3; color
bottle- to olive-green; luster vitreous;
translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Olivine rarely occurs in crystals, but when it
does they belong to the orthorhombic system.
The dark-green grains or masses are recognized
by the color, considerable hardness and indistinct
cleavage. Serpentine may have a similar
color, but its hardness is only 4. In hydrochloric
acid olivine decomposes to a gelatinous mass.</p>
<p>Olivine is typically one of the constituents of
the dark lavas, like basalt, gabbro, or peridotite.
It is also a common mineral in meteorites.
Olivine, in the presence of water, alters to
other minerals, especially serpentine, with great
facility.</p>
<p>It occurs fairly widely wherever the dark lavas
are present, as in the White Mountains of N. H.,
in Loudoun Co., Va., in Lancaster Co., Penn.,
and in many localities in the Rocky Mountains
and Cascade Range.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Epidote">Epidote</a>
<br />Ca&#8322;(AlOH)(AlFe&#8322;)(SiO&#8324;)&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_42">Pl. 42</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in grains or columnar
masses; hardness, 6.5; specific gravity
3.4; color green, usually a
pistachio or yellow-green; luster
vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Rarely epidote occurs in crystals, which belong
to the monoclinic system, and may be either
short like the diagrams on <a href="#Plate_42">plate 42</a> or long and
needle-like. The color and hardness will suffice
to determine this mineral, as almost no other has
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
the peculiar yellowish-green color which is
characteristic of this form.</p>
<p>Epidote occurs primarily in metamorphic
rocks at or near the contact with igneous rocks;
or it may be a secondary mineral resulting from
the weathering of granites, especially along seams.
It sometimes occurs with hornblende in highly
folded schists, as in New York City. It is often
a mineral which has resulted from the alteration
of other minerals, as pyroxene, amphibole,

<h3><a id="species_Tourmaline">Tourmaline</a>
<br />(FeCrNaKLi)&#8324;Mg&#8321;&#8322;B&#8326;Al&#8321;&#8326;H&#8328;Si&#8321;&#8322;O&#8326;&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_42">Pl. 42</a> &amp; <a href="#Plate_Frontispiece">frontispiece</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in three-sided prismatic
crystals; hardness, 7; specific gravity,
3.1; colorless, red, green, brown,
or black; luster vitreous; transparent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>Tourmaline is readily distinguished
from other minerals, as it
always occurs in long to short prisms, which are
three-sided in cross section. There is also a
tendency for the sides to be curved as seen on
the end view of D, <a href="#Plate_42">Pl. 42</a>. Frequently the vertical
edges of the prism are beveled with one, two
or three faces, grouped about each of the three
original edges, and there are often striations on
the prism faces. The ends are terminated by a
low rhombohedron and again there may be a
host of modifying faces on the edges and corners
of the end. The common varieties are brown or
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
black in color, but occasionally there may occur
green, red, yellow or almost any color. When
the crystals are perfect, that is free from impurities
and without tiny cracks, tourmaline becomes
a gem of popularity and value.</p>
<p>Tourmaline is very complex in composition
and may vary considerably, the sodium, potassium,
lithium, magnesium, and iron being either
more or less abundant or even lacking. The color
is to some extent dependent on the proportions
of these elements present, the dark varieties
having more iron, and the light colored tourmalines
lacking it. This mineral is one of those
which form from superheated vapors, escaping
from molten magmas. It will therefore occur in
veins, often associated with copper minerals, in
crystalline limestones, or in cavities in granites,
where it is associated with such minerals, as
beryl, apatite, fluorite, topaz, etc.</p>
<p>If heated tourmaline crystals develop electricity,
with the effect of making one end a positive
and the other a negative pole, and then will attract
bits of straw, ashes, etc. It was first introduced
into Europe about 1703 from India, and
its vogue as a gem has greatly increased since it
was found on Mount Mica near Paris, Me. This
Paris, Me., locality was discovered by two boys,
amateur mineralogists, Elijah L. Hamlin and
Ezekiel Holmes, who in 1820 were returning
home from a trip hunting for minerals, when, at
the root of a tree, they discovered some gleaming
green substance. It proved to be gem-quality
tourmaline. A snow storm that night buried
their &ldquo;claim,&rdquo; but next spring it was visited and
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
several fine crystals found. Later this locality
was systematically worked, and over $50,000
worth of tourmaline taken from the pegmatite
seam in the granite, which lay under the crystals
found on the surface. The figure in the <a href="#Plate_Frontispiece">frontispiece</a>
is one of the crystals from there.</p>
<p>Well known localities are Paris and Hebron,
Me., Goshen and Chesterfield, Mass., Acworth
and Grafton, N. H., Haddam and Munroe,
Conn., Edenville and Port Henry, N. Y., Jefferson
Co., Colo., San Diego Co., Calif., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Kaolinite">Kaolinite</a>
<br />H&#8324;Al&#8322;Si&#8322;O&#8329;
<br /><i>Kaolin</i></h3>
<p>Usually found in whitish clay-like
masses; hardness, 2; specific
gravity, 2.6; color white to grayish
or yellowish; luster dull.</p>
<p>Kaolinite does not generally occur in crystals,
though crystals of microscopic size and monoclinic
forms have been found. It is a secondary
mineral resulting from the decomposition by
weathering of feldspars, the calcium, potassium
or sodium having been replaced by water. When
found in place it is generally white or nearly
white, and is characterized by its greasy feel.</p>
<p>As granites or other feldspar-bearing rocks are
weathered away, the kaolin is washed out by
water, and with other fine material is carried
down into lakes or the sea, where it settles to the
bottom and is known as clay. Clay is kaolin
with more or less impurities.</p>
<p>Pure kaolin is used for the manufacture of
china and white porcelain ware; but when it is
impure, especially when it has iron in it, baking
causes the product to turn red or brown, so
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
that it is only suitable for making tile, bricks,
etc.</p>
<p>It is found almost anywhere that feldspar
rocks are, or have been, exposed to weathering.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Talc">Talc</a>
<br />H&#8322;Mg&#8323;(SiO&#8323;)&#8324;</h3>
<p>Occurs in scales, or in fibrous,
scaly or compact masses; hardness,
1; specific gravity, 2.7; color white,
gray or pale-green; luster pearly; translucent on
thin edges.</p>
<p>This mineral is as soft as any, only graphite
and molybdenite being of the same hardness, but
both these latter two have a black streak, while
the streak of talc is white. The greasy feel is
also characteristic. Talc is very seldom found in
crystals, but if they are found, they will appear like
flakes and have a hexagonal cross section, though
in reality they belong to the monoclinic system.</p>
<p>Talc is a secondary mineral which usually
results from the exposure of magnesium silicates,
such as pyroxenes or amphiboles, to moisture.
In this case, in-as-much as the original rocks were
metamorphic in origin, the talc therefrom will
occur in old metamorphic regions. Some talc is
also formed by the action of silica-bearing waters
on dolomite. This is likely to be the case near
the contact between dolomite and igneous rocks.
Talc is closely related to serpentine and likely
to be found in the same regions.</p>
<p>Talc has come to have a considerable use.
Some of it is compact and then called soapstone,
and this was used by the ancient Chinese to make
images and ornaments; and our North American
Indians used it to make large pots, to serve as
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
containers for liquids. Some of these pots have
been carved out with great skill, so as to be fairly
light in proportion to what they would hold.
Pipes and images were also carved from soapstone.
Today we still cut soapstone into slabs
to make mantels, laundry tubs and sinks. The
scaly and fibrous varieties are ground, and used
in making paper, paint, roofing, rubber, soap,
crayons, toilet powders, etc. The United States
produce and use over half the world&rsquo;s production,
our industries requiring over 100,000 tons of talc
a year. Of this 38% goes into paper, 23% into
paint, 18% into roofing, and so on down to toilet
powder which uses 2&frac12;%, or 2,500 tons a year.</p>
<p>Talc is found in metamorphosed regions, that
is in New England, all down the east side of the
Appalachian Mts., in the Rocky Mts., and the
Cascade Ranges, with a large number of local
occurrences. New York State is the leading producer.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Serpentine">Serpentine</a>
<br />H&#8324;Mg&#8323;Si&#8322;O&#8329;
<br /><a href="#Plate_43">Pl. 43</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in compact, granular or
fibrous masses; hardness, 3; specific
gravity, 2.6; color green; luster
greasy; translucent on thin edges. Serpentine
is never in crystals. Its color and hardness
serve to distinguish it. Like talc it is a secondary
mineral resulting from the alteration, in
the presence of moisture, of pyroxenes, amphiboles,
and especially, olivine. As these are often
in metamorphic rocks, the serpentine is likely to
be associated with metamorphic rocks. Some
serpentine is also the result of the action of silica-bearing
water on dolomite, and this is likely to
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
occur in areas of sedimentary rocks. The fibrous
variety of serpentine, <i>chrysolite</i>, usually occurs in
seams or veins, and when the fibers are long, it is
used as asbestos. This form of asbestos is the
one most used commercially today, as there are
remarkably large deposits of it in the Province of
Quebec, which provide the major part of the
world supply. In the United States it is also
found in California and Arizona but only in
moderate quantities.</p>
<p>Massive serpentine is used in considerable
quantities as an ornamental stone, the green
color varied with streaks and blotches of white,
yellow and red, due to various impurities, making
it very effective. It is, however, only suitable
for interior work as the weather quickly spoils
the polished surface. This is further discussed
under serpentine rock, <a href="#Page_245">page 245</a>.</p>
<p>Serpentine is found at Newfane, Vt., Newburyport,
Mass., Brewster, Antwerp, etc., N. Y.,
Hoboken, N. J., in Pennsylvania, Maryland, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Chlorite">Chlorite</a>

<br /><a href="#Plate_43">Pl. 43</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in monoclinic crystals of
six-sided outline, or in scaly flakes
or masses; hardness, 2; specific
gravity 2.8; color green; luster pearly
on cleavage faces; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Chlorite is a family name, covering a series of
closely related minerals, so similar in appearance
that they are best considered under this common
name. In many respects they resemble mica, in
the shape of the crystals and the remarkable
basal cleavage. At first glance it is easy to confuse
the two, but chlorite scales are not elastic,
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
and when bent, stay bent, instead of snapping
back like mica. In fact they look like more or
less rotted micas. This is more than appearance,
for chlorites form as a result of the alteration of
micas in the presence of moisture. They are
then secondary, and will be found where mica-rocks
have been weathered, as in granites and
schists.</p>
<p>They may be expected anywhere that micas
have been long exposed, as in New England, the
Rocky Mountains, or the Sierra Nevada or Cascade
Ranges. Special localities are Brewster,
N. Y., Unionville and Texas, Penn., etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Zeolites</span></h3>
<p>The zeolites are a group of white minerals,
with a pearly luster, light weight, and easy solubility
in acids; which, because their contained
water is lightly held, readily boil before the blowpipe.
They are all secondary minerals, which
result from the decomposition of feldspars, when
exposed to weathering. They are almost universally
found in seams and cavities of disintegrating
lavas. From a group of a dozen or so,
three are common enough to be considered here.
They may be found by watching such places, as
where trap rock is being quarried for road material,
or being blasted for any reason.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Analcite">Analcite</a>
<br />Na&#8323;Al&#8322;Si&#8324;O&#8321;&#8323; + 2H&#8322;O
<br /><a href="#Plate_44">Pl. 44</a></h3>
<p>Occurs as trapezohedrons in seams
and cavities in lavas; hardness, 5.5;
specific gravity, 2.2; colorless, white
or pink; luster vitreous; transparent
on thin edges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Analcite usually occurs in the 24-sided form,
known as a trapezohedron, as illustrated in figure
A, <a href="#Plate_44">Pl. 44</a>; but it may also occur in cubes with the
three faces of the trapezohedron on each corner.
Small crystals are often colorless, but the larger
ones are either white or pink, and are opaque.
While the form is the same as that of garnets, the
color, lesser hardness, and the occurrence in
lavas will serve to distinguish this mineral. If
placed in hydrochloric acid analcite dissolves
to a gelatinous mass.</p>
<p>It is always found in seams and cavities in
lavas, as at Bergen Hill and Weehawken, N. J.,
Westfield, Mass., in the Lake Superior region, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Natrolite">Natrolite</a>

<p>Occurs as bristling crystals in
seams and cavities in lavas; hardness,
5.5; specific gravity, 2.2; colorless;
luster vitreous; transparent on
thin edges.</p>
<p>Natrolite occurs as beautiful bristling tufts of
needle-like crystals, each crystal an orthorhombic
prism with a very low pyramid on the end.
This mineral is so easily fusible that it can be
melted in a candle flame, giving to the flame the
characteristic yellow color due to sodium. In
hydrochloric acid it dissolves to a gelatinous
mass. It is always a secondary mineral in cavities
and seams in disintegrating lavas, and the
tuft-like manner of growth is so characteristic,
that once seen, it will always be recognized.</p>
<p>Natrolite is found at Weehawken and Bergen
Hill, N. J., at Westfield, Mass., in the Lake
Superior region, etc.</p>

<p>Usually occurs in sheaf-like
bundles of fibrous crystals; hardness,
5.5; specific gravity 2.2; colorless
to white, yellow or brown; luster
vitreous; transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Stilbite crystals are really monoclinic, but on
account of almost universal twinning, appear as
if orthorhombic. Like the two foregoing minerals,
stilbite is found in the seams and cavities of
disintegrating lavas. It is readily recognized by
its habit of forming in sheaf-like bundles of
fibrous crystals. It may also, but more rarely,
occur in radiating masses. In hydrochloric acid
it is completely dissolved. It is found in lavas,
at Weehawken and Bergen Hill, N. J., in the
Lake Superior region, etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Calcium</span></h3>
<p>Calcium is one of the most abundant of metals,
but never occurs as such in nature, nor is it used
as a metal by man. In its metallic form it is
yellowish-white, and intermediate between lead
and gold in hardness. Exposed to air it soon
tarnishes by oxidation, and in water rapidly decomposes
the water, forming the oxide. However,
it has a great affinity for other elements,
and makes a large number of minerals, the most
important of which are calcite, aragonite, gypsum
and fluorite, while it is an essential component
of some garnets, anorthite, epidote, amphibole
and pyroxene. It is very widely distributed
as limestone, and is found in solution in most all
natural waters, and in the shells and bones of
many animals and some plants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<h3><a id="species_Calcite">Calcite</a>
<br />CaCO&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_45">Pl. 45</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in well defined crystals
in incrustations, and in stalactitic,
oolitic, and granular masses; hardness,
3; specific gravity 2.7; colorless to white, or
when impure, yellow, brown, green, red or blue;
luster vitreous to dull; transparent on thin
edges.</p>
<p>Next to quartz, calcite is the most abundant of
all minerals, and occurs in an almost endless
variety of forms, over 300 having been described.
It belongs to the hemihedral section of the hexagonal
system, the form of the crystals being all
sorts of variations of the rhombohedron, and
combinations of left and right handed rhombohedrons.
The cleavage is entirely uniform, in three
directions, parallel to the faces of the rhombohedron,
and at an angle of 74&deg; 55&prime; with each other.
Crystals may occur in the form characteristic of
the cleavage, but not often. The commonest
forms are a more or less elongated scalenohedron,
made by combining right and left handed rhombohedrons,
so that the resulting pyramid is six-sided,
as in figure C, <a href="#Plate_45">Plate 45</a>. Such a scalenohedron
may be combined with other forms in a
great variety of ways. The six-sided prism with
the ends terminated by one or more sets of
rhombohedral faces is also fairly common.
Twinning occurs occasionally.</p>
<p>The quickest way to determine calcite is by
the hardness (3), combined with the fact that it
effervesces, when hydrochloric acid is dropped
upon it.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of this mineral is its
marked property of deflecting light rays, so that
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
a line or object placed behind a piece of clear
calcite appears double. It was with pieces of
calcite from Iceland that this was first seen; so
that large transparent crystals of calcite are still
called <i>Iceland spar</i>; and such calcite is used to
make the Nichol&rsquo;s prisms for microscopes, which
are so useful in the study of minerals. This
power of refracting light is present in all minerals,
but not to such a marked degree as in calcite.
The elongated scalenohedrons of calcite are often
called &ldquo;dog-toothed spar&rdquo; from a fancied resemblance
between them and the dog&rsquo;s tooth.</p>
<p>Calcite is present in solution in the water of
the sea and most streams, from which it is withdrawn
by many animals and some plants, to
make their shells, and bones. The foraminifera,
some sponges, the echinoderms, corals and molluscs
all draw large quantities from the water in
which they live, and build more or less permanent
structures from it. These shells when they fall
to the bottom, or after being broken to bits,
accumulate on the bottom and make limestone,
which is widely distributed over the country.
This same limestone, when metamorphosed and
crystalline, is marble.</p>
<p>Calcite then is readily soluble in water, and
streams flowing along crevices and fissures in
limestone dissolve out great cavities or caves,
like the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky. Other
water, percolating through the limestone, comes
to these cavities saturated with lime in solution
and drips from the roofs and walls; then as part
of the water evaporates, it deposits part of its
lime in icicle-like masses, hanging from the roof.
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
Such masses of non-crystalline calcite are called
<i>stalactites</i>. Below on the floor of the cave, conical
masses are built up in the same manner where the
dripping water falls on the floor. These are
<i>stalagmites</i>. In these limestone caves and in
smaller cavities many of the most beautiful
crystals grow. Somewhat similarly, when hot
water from deep springs comes to the surface,
it cools and can not carry as much lime, and so
around the spring is laid down layer after layer
of non-crystalline calcite making a mass known
as <i>travertine</i>. Sometimes this is colored by iron
or other impurities and a banded effect results.
Such travertine as the &ldquo;Suisun marble&rdquo; from
California, &ldquo;California onyx,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mexican onyx,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;satin spar&rdquo; all belong to this class.</p>
<p>The coral animals, especially in tropical waters
precipitate an enormous amount of lime, until
whole reefs are built of lime in this non-crystalline
form. In places it is hundreds of feet thick
and hundreds of miles in extent. Some of this
coral has become popular for personal adornment.
This is particularly a small, fine-grained
variety, <i>Corallum rubrum</i>, which lives almost
exclusively in the Mediterranean Sea. This coral
is red in color, varying all the way from a deep
red to white. It grows in small masses, three
pounds being a good sized mass, in water 60
to 100 feet deep, requires some ten years to
develop a full-sized mass. The making of this
into beads and ornaments is an Italian industry.
The demand is growing, while at the same time
the supply is diminishing, and search is being
widely made for more such coral, but up to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
present time with little success. This precious
coral is much worn as a protection against the
&ldquo;evil eye&rdquo; and is widely imitated, apparently
with as much protection to the wearer. When
coral beads are offered cheap, they are probably
something else, red gypsum being much used.
This and all imitations can be readily detected by
trying a drop of acid in the bead. Coral will effervesce,
but gypsum and other substitutes will not.</p>
<p>The bulk of the shells of most molluscs is made
of lime, but the mother-of-pearl layer inside is
usually aragonite. The chalk of the cliffs on
either side of the English channel is lime, and
composed of the shells of single celled animals.
See <a href="#Page_213">p. 213</a>. When lime is deposited in loose porous
masses, as around grass, etc., and below hot
springs, this mass is termed <i>calcareous tufa</i>.</p>
<p>Calcite will be found almost everywhere, some
of the localities for the finest crystals being Antwerp
and Lockport, N. Y., Middletown, Conn.,
the caves of Kentucky, Warsaw, Ill., Joplin, Mo.,
Hazel Green, Wis., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Aragonite">Aragonite</a>
<br />CaCO&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_46">Pl. 46</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals, in columnar or
fibrous masses, or incrustations;
hardness, 3.5; specific gravity, 2.9;
colorless, white or amber; luster vitreous; transparent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>Aragonite has the same chemical composition
as calcite, but it crystallizes in the orthorhombic
system, either in simple forms like A on <a href="#Plate_46">Plate 46</a>,
or twinned, so as to make forms which seem hexagonal.
When in simple crystals its form easily
distinguishes it from calcite and dolomite, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
when twinned it appears much like either of
these two minerals. From calcite it can then be
distinguished by its greater hardness and the fact
that it has cleavage in one direction only, and
that imperfect. The cleavage is the only easy
method of distinguishing it from dolomite. However,
aragonite is most always easily distinguished
by its habits, for it generally forms long
slender crystals, which appear more like fibers
than crystals. Neither calcite nor dolomite is at
all fibrous.</p>
<p>Aragonite is much less abundant than calcite,
and has resulted, either from deposition from hot
waters, or from waters having sulphates in solution
as well as lime. Much of the travertine, and
many stalagmites and stalactites are composed
of aragonites, forming as outlined under calcite.
The mother-of-pearl layer in the shells of bivalves
is generally aragonite. The pearly luster of this
layer is due to its being formed by the successive
deposition of one thin layer upon another; so
that light falling on the mother-of-pearl, penetrates,
part of it to one layer and part to another,
and is then reflected. Certain molluscs have this
layer composed of especially thin layers, one, the
<i>Unios</i> or freshwater clams, the other, the &ldquo;pearl
oysters&rdquo; or <i>Aviculid&aelig;</i>, these latter, however,
being only distantly related to the edible oysters.
In the cases, where molluscs of either of these two
families are of large size, large pieces of mother-of-pearl
can be recovered, and are used for buttons,
handles, and various ornamental objects.
A further peculiarity of these same molluscs is
the formation of pearls in the sheet of flesh, lining
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
the shells. The pearls are round or rounded
concretions of aragonite. At the center there is
a grain of sand, or more often a tiny dead parasite.
Either was an irritant to the mollusc, and
to be rid of it, a layer of aragonite was secreted
around it. Then as the mollusc continued to
grow and secrete layers for its shell, it also added
each time another layer around the sand-grain
or parasite, until in time a pearl of noticeable,
and then of considerable size resulted. These
have all the pearly luster of the mother-of-pearl
in a sphere which tends to make the luster even
more marked.</p>
<p>Pearls were in use as ornaments in China some
twenty-three centuries before Christ, and in
India over 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> They were very highly
prized by the Romans and since their times the
rulers of India have shown a remarkable fondness
for them. Today the finest come from the
Gulf of Persia and the Red Sea, while still
others are found about Australia and in the
Caribbean Sea. In the United States not a few
are collected every year from the fresh water
clams, some of them beautifully tinted with
pink or yellow.</p>
<p>Aragonite is found widely, as at Haddam,
Conn., Edenville, N. Y., Hoboken, N. J., New
Garden, Penn., Warsaw, Ill., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Anhydrite">Anhydrite</a>
<br />CaSO&#8324;

white, gray, bluish or reddish; luster pearly on
cleavage faces; transparent on thin edges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>When anhydrite occurs in crystals, they are
orthorhombic, like the diagram on <a href="#Plate_46">Plate 46</a>.
Usually, however, it is found in beds or layers,
which were deposited by the evaporation of sea
water, and so it is associated with salt. Anhydrite
has three cleavage planes which are at right
angles to one another, which produce rectangular
or cube-like forms. Mostly anhydrite is associated
with gypsum, from which it differs by its
greater hardness, pseudo-cubic cleavage, and the
fact that anhydrite is not readily soluble in acid,
while gypsum is. Chemically it differs from gypsum
in not having water of crystallization, which
gypsum does have. The anhydrite is likely to
occur as veins and irregular masses in beds of
gypsum. Calcium sulphate is precipitated from
sea water when 37% of the water has been evaporated,
and it may be deposited either as anhydrite
or as gypsum, the factors, which decide
as to which of these two minerals it will be, being
as yet unknown. After deposition, if exposed to
moisture, the anhydrite may change to gypsum,
irregular masses often remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>It is found in salt mines in Elsworth Co., Kan.,
in limestone cavities at Lockport, N. Y., in veins
in Shasta Co., Calif., etc.</p>

thin edges.</p>
<p>Gypsum crystals are monoclinic as seen on
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
<a href="#Plate_47">Plate 47</a>, the perfect ones usually occurring in
clay, as at Oxford, O., or in cavities; while crystals
of less perfect outline, but with fine cleavages,
are found in Utah, Kansas, and Colorado.
The cleavage is very perfect in one direction,
making it possible to strip off thin sheets almost
like mica, and less perfect in two other directions,
which appear on the smooth surface of the first
cleavage as lines intersecting at 66&deg; 14&prime;. Twinning
is also common in such a way, that the two
united crystals make forms similar to arrowheads.
These cleavages and the twinning show
nicely in the photograph of gypsum on <a href="#Plate_47">Plate 47</a>.</p>
<p>Gypsum is distinguished from anhydrite by its
lesser hardness, its cleavage and by being soluble
in acids.</p>
<p>Most gypsum occurs in beds or granular
masses which were deposited from evaporating
sea-water, coming down when 37% of the water
was lost. Such beds are often very extensive and
are quarried as a source of gypsum to make plaster
of Paris, stucco, neat plaster, Keene&rsquo;s cement,
plaster and wall board, partition tiles, etc. The
use of the gypsum for plaster of Paris and all
these other uses is based on its affinity for water
of crystallization. The gypsum is first heated to
about 400&deg; C., which drives off the water of crystallization,
and causes it to crumble to a powder,
which is the plaster of Paris. When water is
added, it is taken up and the powder &ldquo;sets,&rdquo; or
recrystallizes back to gypsum. This simple
reaction has made it very useful, for making
moulds, casts, hard finish on walls, as stucco, etc.</p>
<p>When the granular type of gypsum is fine
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
grained, it is known as <i>alabaster</i>, which is used for
carving vases, statuettes, ornaments, etc. The
fibrous variety is called <i>satin spar</i>, and is sometimes
used for cheap jewelry and ornaments, but
it is very soft and quickly wears out. At Niagara
Falls there is a considerable trade in objects
carved from this satin spar, tourists buying them
on the assumption that the mineral is native and
comes from under the falls. Most of it, however,
comes from Wales, the small amount of gypsum
of that region being mostly granular.</p>
<p>Gypsum is found all across the United States,
as in New York, Michigan, Virginia, Ohio, Alabama,
South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado,
Utah, California, etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Strontium Group</span></h3>
<p>Strontium is a pale-yellow metal, ductile and
malleable, but oxidizing quickly when exposed
to the air. It does not occur in its native state
in Nature, but always as some compound, usually
either the carbonate or sulphate. It resembles
barium, but differs in giving to the
flame a brilliant red color, on which account the
compounds of strontium are used mostly in
making red fire in fireworks.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Strontianite">Strontianite</a>
<br />SrCO&#8323;</h3>
<p>Occurs in needle-like crystals, or
in columnar or fibrous masses; hardness,
3.5-4; specific gravity, 3.6;
color white, pale-green or pale shades of yellow;
luster vitreous; transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Strontianite is orthorhombic, but appears as
if hexagonal, since its general habit is to have
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
three twin crystals grow together in such a way
as to make a six-sided double pyramid. In this
it is very like witherite, both these minerals appearing
externally much alike. They can be
readily distinguished, however, by holding a
piece in the flame. If it gives a red color to the
flame it is strontianite, if green, it is witherite.
It effervesces readily in hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p>Strontianite is found in veins and cavities in
limestone, where it has been deposited after
being leached from the limestone by percolating
waters. Though known at several localities it is
not now being mined in this country, what we
use being imported mostly from Germany.</p>
<p>It is found at Schoharie, Chaumont Bay and
Theresa, N. Y., in Mifflin Co., Penn., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Celestite">Celestite</a>
<br />SrSO&#8324;</h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals, cleavable
masses and fibrous; hardness, 3;
specific gravity, 3.9; colorless, white,
pale-blue, or reddish; luster vitreous; transparent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>Celestite, the sulphate of strontium, is very like
barite in external appearance and habit. It is
orthorhombic and occurs in tabular crystals.
Its cleavage is perfect on the basal plane, and
imperfect in one other direction. The ready way
of distinguishing celestite from barite is to hold a
piece in the flame. If it is celestite it will color
the flame red, if barite, green.</p>
<p>Celestite is mostly found in veins or cavities in
limestone, where it has been deposited by percolating
waters, after having been leached from
the limestone. Some years ago an important
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
deposit of celestite was found on Strontian Island
in Lake Erie, but that was soon worked out and
now no veins are being worked in this country.
It is also found at Chaumont Bay, Schoharie
and Lockport, N. Y., in Kansas, Texas, West
Virginia, Tennessee, etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Barium Group</span></h3>
<p>Barium is another metal which does not occur
in its native state in Nature. It has only been
isolated as a yellow powder, which, exposed to
air or water, soon changes to one of the oxides.
Both barium and its compounds are peculiar in
causing a green color, whenever exposed to the
flame. Two of its compounds are fairly abundant,
the sulphate, barite, and the carbonate,
witherite. The former is the more abundant and
has come to be fairly widely used, something
over 100,000 tons being annually consumed in the
United States, to make the body in flat finish
paints for interior work and light colors, for a
filler in rubber goods, linoleum, oil cloth, glazed paper,
and for a wide range of chemical compounds.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Barite">Barite</a>
<br />BaSO&#8324;
<br /><a href="#Plate_48">Pl. 48</a>
<br /><i>heavy spar</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals or in lamellar,
nodular or granular masses; hardness
3; specific gravity, 4.5; colorless,
white or almost any color; luster
vitreous; transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Barite occurs in orthorhombic crystals, which
are tabular in form, and usually have the edges
beveled, as in figure A, <a href="#Plate_48">Plate 48</a>. There is cleavage
in three directions, a rather perfect basal
cleavage, and two less perfect cleavages, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
are at right angles to the basal cleavage plane,
and intersect each other at 78&deg;.</p>
<p>The tabular form, the cleavage, the heavy
weight, and the fact that a piece of barite put
into the flame colors it green, all serve to distinguish
this mineral.</p>
<p>Barite is a secondary mineral of aqueous origin,
which has been deposited in veins and cavities
in igneous, metamorphic, or sometimes sedimentary
rocks. It is most likely to occur in
veins in igneous or metamorphic rocks, the
barium having been dissolved from certain feldspars
and micas by percolating water, and then
redeposited in the fissures, as the water came into
them. If in sedimentary rocks, the barite veins
are usually in limestones. Barite is quite likely
to be a gangue mineral for the ores of lead.</p>
<p>It is found at Hatfield and Leverett, Mass.,
Cheshire, Conn., Pillar Point, N. Y., Cartersville,
Ga., in Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama,
Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada, California,
Alaska, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Witherite">Witherite</a>
<br />BaCO&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_48">Pl. 48</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals, or in granular
or columnar masses; hardness, 3.5;
specific gravity, 4.3; color white to
gray; luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Witherite is not an abundant mineral. Its
crystals are really orthorhombic, but they are
usually twinned, three crystals growing through
each other in such a manner that the resulting
crystal appears like a six-sided double pyramid,
similar to the one figured on <a href="#Plate_48">Plate 48</a>. The commonest
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
mode of occurrence is in compact
masses. Witherite effervesces when cold acid is
dropped upon it, which, with its heavy weight,
and the green color it gives to the flame, serves
to distinguish the mineral. It is used for medicines,
in chemical industries, and a considerable
amount is made into rat poisons. The chief
locality for witherite is in northern England,
but in this country it is found along with barite,
especially at Lexington, Ky., and in Michigan.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Carbon</span></h3>
<p>Carbon is an element widely distributed in
nature, occasionally appearing in its elementary
form, as graphite or the diamond, but much more
important in its compounds. Small quantities
are present in the air as carbon dioxide, CO&#8322;, immense
quantities occurring in the carbonate
minerals, which have been considered under their
respective metallic salts, as calcite, malachite,
siderite, cerrusite, smithsonite, witherite, etc.,
and still other large quantities being represented
in organic compounds, which occur as rocks
under the heads of petroleum, coal, etc. The
occurrence of limestones, graphite, coal or petroleum
is always indicative of the activity of living
organisms, and in some cases is the only indication
of life in the earlier rocks.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Graphite">Graphite</a>
<br />C
<br /><i>Plumbago</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in hexagonal scales or
flakes, in layered masses, or earthy
lumps; hardness, 1; specific gravity,
2.1; color black or steel-gray; streak gray; luster
metallic; opaque on thin edges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Like the diamond graphite is pure carbon, but
in this case it is in non-crystalline form. It
occurs in both igneous and metamorphic rocks.
In the former case it is either in flakes in the rock,
or in veins, and has been derived directly from
the molten magmas, having either precipitated
in the hardening granite or lava, or having been
carried into the fissures and there precipitated
to make the veins of graphite. In either case
the graphite probably represents organic deposits
which have been melted into the igneous magma
at the time of its formation. Graphite may also
occur in metamorphic rocks, beds of coal or other
organic deposits being altered by the heat. Such
beds are often of considerable extent and economic
importance.</p>
<p>The extreme softness, greasy feel, and the
dark-gray streak readily distinguish graphite.</p>
<p>It is widely used in making crucibles and furnace
linings for foundries, lead pencils, paint,
lubricating powders, etc.</p>
<p>Graphite is found at Brandon, Vt., Sturbridge,
Mass., Ashford, Conn., in Essex, Warren and
Washington Cos., N. Y., Clay, Chilton and
Coosa Cos., Ala., Raton, N. M., Dillon, Mont.,
etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Diamond">Diamond</a>
<br />C</h3>
<p>Occurs in octahedral crystals;
hardness, 10; specific gravity, 3.5;
colorless to yellow, brown, blue, etc.,
luster adamantine; transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Like graphite the diamond is pure carbon, but
in this case in crystal form. It is the hardest of
all minerals, and as brilliant as any; so that in
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
spite of being by no means the rarest, it may
easily be considered the most popular of all gems.
Tiny diamonds have been made artificially under
great heat and pressure; so that this mineral is
thought of as forming in Nature in dark igneous
lavas at great depths. The diamond has good
cleavage parallel to the octahedron faces, and,
in spite of some traditions to the contrary, is
brittle.</p>
<p>There are not many diamond localities, the
most famous being the Kimberley district of
South Africa, which produces many times as
many diamonds as all the others put together,
though all the time some are being found in
Borneo and Brazil. A very few have been found
in the United States, only one locality however
yielding them in the original matrix. That is at
Murfreesboro, Ark., where they are mined in a
disintegrating peridotite (a dark lava, mostly
peridot), which has been extruded through the
sedimentary rocks of that region. This matrix
is similar to the &ldquo;blue earth,&rdquo; the matrix of the
diamonds of South Africa, which occurs in
&ldquo;pipes,&rdquo; representing the necks of ancient volcanoes.
The American diamonds are of small
size, averaging considerably less than a third of
a carat in weight, which does not allow great
value to the individual diamonds.</p>
<p>From time to time, especially large diamonds
have been found in different parts of the world,
the largest being the Cullinan diamond, found
at the Premier Diamond Mine of South Africa.
It weighed 3025 carats or about a pound and a
quarter, and was valued at over $3,000,000. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
was presented to King Edward VII, who had it
cut into 11 brilliants, four of which are larger
than any other diamond yet found. Other famous
diamonds, like the Kohinoor, 106 carats,
found in India in 1304; the Regent, 136 carats,
also found in India; the Orloff, 193 carats, set in
the eye of an Indian idol; the South Star, 125
carats, the largest ever found in Brazil; the blue
Hope, etc., have in many cases romantic and
interesting stories woven about them.</p>
<p>Though for ages diamonds have been highly
prized gems, it is only in comparatively recent
times that cutting and polishing have been resorted
to, for the purpose of enhancing their
brilliancy. This is done by grinding reflecting
faces on the original stone, by the aid of discs of
iron or tin in which diamond dust has been embedded.
Diamond chips and cloudy or imperfect
diamonds are used for making tools for cutting
glass, rock drills, etc.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Phosphorus</span></h3>
<p>The element phosphorus at ordinary temperatures
is an almost colorless, faintly yellow, solid
substance of glistening appearance and waxy
consistency. In Nature it does not occur pure,
but always as one of its compounds. It is of
great importance to man for it is one of the essentials
for plant growth and also for the higher
animals, being required for the bones and to some
extent for nervous tissue. Originally it is found
in all the igneous rocks. Some of the phosphorus
is removed by solution and carried to other regions
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
and to the sea. From this distribution it
comes into the sedimentary rocks, and, when
they are altered by heat, into the metamorphic
rocks. Thus it has a wide, though by no means
even, distribution. The soils formed by disintegration
of these rocks probably all have some
phosphorus in them; but where there is vigorous
plant growth, it soon tends to become exhausted,
and must be renewed. For this reason the use of
phosphates has become of prime importance in
Agriculture. The possession of beds of rock
carrying phosphorus has come to be of international
importance. The United States is particularly
fortunate in this respect, and produces
over 25% of the world&rsquo;s supply of phosphates.
Most all the phosphorus is recovered either
from phosphate minerals, the most important
of which is apatite, or from the non-crystalline
and impure mixtures of phosphate minerals
and other substances, discussed under phosphate
rock.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Apatite">Apatite</a>
<br />Ca&#8325;F(PO&#8324;)&#8323;
<br /><a href="#Plate_49">Pl. 49</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals, concretionary
nodules, or in bedded masses; hardness,
5; specific gravity, 3.2; color
reddish-brown or green, rarely white or colorless;
luster vitreous; translucent on thin
edges.</p>
<p>Apatite occurs in hexagonal prisms, usually
with the ends truncated by a basal plane, and
with one or more sets of pyramidal faces between
the prism and the basal plane. Crystals range in
size from tiny to over a foot in diameter. There
is but one cleavage and that is basal. The crystal
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
form, cleavage, and hardness will easily
determine this mineral. Apatite is usually associated
with igneous or highly metamorphic
rocks, such as granites, gneisses, and crystalline
limestones. While the phosphoric acid of apatite
is highly desirable for use in fertilizers, the crystals
do not occur in sufficient abundance to
make them commercially available, and non-crystalline
phosphate rocks are resorted to for
this purpose.</p>
<p>Crystals of apatite are found at Norwich and
Bolton, Mass., Rossie and Edenville, N. Y.,
Suckasunny and Hurdstown, N. J., Leiperville,
Penn., Wilmington, Del., etc. Templeton, Canada,
is perhaps the best known locality for fine
apatite.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Turquois">Turquois</a>
<br />H&#8325;[Al(OH)&#8322;]Cu(OH)(PO&#8324;)&#8324;</h3>
<p>Occurs in seams and incrustations;
hardness, 6; specific gravity,
2.7; color bluish-green; streak blue;
luster waxy; translucent to opaque on thin
edges.</p>
<p>In this country this complex phosphate of
aluminum and copper is found in streaks and
patches in volcanic rocks, but in Persia comes
from metamorphic rocks. To the Persians it was
a magical stone, protecting the wearer from injuries,
and among the Pueblo Indians it was
regarded as of religious value in warding off evil.
The best turquois comes from Persia, but it has
been found at several points in the United States,
as in Los Cerrillos and Burro Mts., N. M., in
Mohave Co., Ariz., San Bernardino Co., Cal.,
in Nevada and Colorado.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Fluorine</span></h3>
<p>At ordinary temperatures the element fluorine
is a colorless gas, which was not obtained pure
until 1888, because it could not be contained in
vessels of glass, gold, platinum, etc. At that
time it was made and kept in a vessel composed
of an alloy of platinum and iridium. Its most
important compound is hydrofluoric acid, a fuming
liquid, which is mostly used to etch or dissolve
glass. It occurs in several minerals, like
tourmaline, turquois, etc., but the only one used
to obtain the hydrofluoric acid is fluorite.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Fluorite">Fluorite</a>
<br />CaF&#8322;
<br /><a href="#Plate_50">Pl. 50</a>
<br /><i>Fluor spar</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals and cleavable
masses; hardness, 4; specific gravity,
3.2; colorless or some shade of violet,
green, yellow, or rose; luster vitreous; transparent
on thin edges.</p>
<p>Fluorite usually occurs in beautiful cubic
crystals, often with the edges and corners beveled
by smaller faces, and occasionally in twins,
which seem to have grown through each other.
There is perfect cleavage parallel to each of the
octahedral faces, which often, as in the illustration
on <a href="#Plate_50">Plate 50</a>, show as cracks cutting off the
corners.</p>
<p>Since fluorite loses weight and color on heating,
it is concluded that the colors are due to the
presence of hydrocarbon compounds. The red
and the green fluorite when heated to above
212&deg; F. become phosphorescent, as may be seen
if they are thus heated and exposed to the light,
then taken into the dark.</p>
<p>Fluorite is quite commonly the gangue mineral
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
associated with metallic ores, and is also likely
to occur with topaz, apatite, etc. It is generally
in such places that it seems to have been deposited
from hot vapors, rising from igneous
magmas.</p>
<p>It is the only mineral at all common from
which fluorine can be obtained, and is used for
making hydrofluoric acid, and other chemical
compounds of this element. It is, however, of
much greater importance as a flux in reducing
iron, silver, lead and copper ores. In the industries
it finds a place, being used to make apochromatic
lenses, cheap jewelry, and for the
electrodes in flaming arc lamps.</p>
<p>Fluorite is widely distributed, some of the
better known localities being Trumbull and Plymouth,
Conn., Rossie and Muscalonge Lake,
N. Y., Gallatin Co., Ill., Thunder Bay, Lake
Superior, Missouri, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Halite">Halite</a>
<br />NaCl
<br /><a href="#Plate_50">Pl. 50</a>
<br /><i>Salt</i></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals, and in cleavable
and granular masses; hardness,
2.5; specific gravity, 2.1; colorless to
white; luster vitreous; transparent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Halite is common salt, occurring in cubic
crystals, with perfect cubic cleavage. Its form,
hardness, taste, and solubility in water make it
easy to determine.</p>
<p>Halite is the most abundant salt in sea water,
making about 2.5% out of the total of 3.5% of
solids in solution. It is also a prominent, when
not the leading, salt in solution in the waters of
inland lakes, like Great Salt Lake, or the Dead
Sea, there being 20% of halite in the former and
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
8% in the latter, though the total of solid in
solution in the water of the Dead Sea is greater
than that in Great Salt Lake.</p>
<p>The great salt deposits are mostly the result of
the evaporation of the water of arms or isolated
portions of former oceans; the salt, gypsum, etc.,
left by the drying sea, having been buried beneath
later sediments. Other bodies of salt represent
the disappearance of ancient lakes.
There are also the curious &ldquo;salt domes&rdquo; of
Louisiana and Texas, which are immense, roughly
circular, subterranean masses of salt extending to
as yet unknown depths which are thought to have
been formed by masses of salt from some deep
source bed pushing their way upward through the
overlying formations by plastic flowage. As the
upthrust took place the sediments were arched
into domes. Some of these domes are today important
sources of rock salt.</p>
<p>There are extensive beds of salt under parts of
New York, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Kansas,
etc., which are mostly worked by drilling wells
into the salt layer, then introducing hot water to
dissolve the salt. The brine thus formed is
pumped to the surface, and the salt recovered by
evaporation in pans. During the process, skeleton
crystals of salt with concave faces may form,
but in Nature the crystals are uniformly solid
cubes.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Boracite">Boracite</a>
<br />Mg&#8327;Cl&#8322;B&#8321;&#8326;O&#8323;&#8320;</h3>
<p>Occurs in small crystals or granular
masses; hardness of crystals, 7;
of the masses, 4.5; specific gravity
3; colorless to white; luster vitreous; transparent
to translucent on thin edges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Small crystals, associated with salt and gypsum,
occur in the beds and incrustations, which
result from the drying up of alkaline lakes,
especially in Nevada and southern California.
The crystals are orthorhombic, but appear like
perfect cubes, with the edges beveled and part of
the corners cut. They are not easily dissolved in
water, but quickly go into solution in hydrochloric
acid.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Colemanite">Colemanite</a>
<br />Ca&#8322;B&#8326;O&#8321;&#8321; + 5H&#8322;O</h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals or compact
masses; hardness, 4.5; specific gravity,
2.4; colorless to white; luster
vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>The crystals when they occur, are monoclinic;
but usually colemanite is a bedded deposit,
which has resulted from the drying up of a saline
lake. It was first found in Death Valley, Cal.,
in 1882, then near Daggett, Cal., and since then in
several similar locations in Nevada and Oregon.
The deposits are of all grades of purity, the colemanite
being mixed with varying quantities of
mud. Today this mineral is the chief source of
borax, which is used in medicines, cosmetics,
colored glazes, enamel, and as a preservative.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Borax">Borax</a>
<br />NaB&#8324;O&#8327; + 10H&#8322;O</h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals or in powdery
incrustations; hardness, 2; specific
gravity, 1.7; colorless to white;
luster vitreous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>The crystals are tiny and monoclinic, this
mineral being usually obtained by the evaporation
of the saline waters of such lakes as Clear and
Borax Lakes in southern California, or from the
muds of salt marshes, like Searles Borax Marsh
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
in California. Originally most of our borax
came from a large saline lake in Tibet, but now
most of it is obtained from colemanite. Borax is
soluble in water, giving it a sweetish taste.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Sulphur">Sulphur</a>
<br />S
<br /><a href="#Plate_51">Pl. 51</a></h3>
<p>Occurs in crystals, incrustations or
compact masses; hardness, 2; specific
gravity, 2; color yellow; streak
yellow; luster resinous; translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Aside from the numerous compounds, such as
the sulphides of the metals like pyrite, galena,
sphalerite, etc., and the sulphates, like gypsum,
barite, anglesite, etc., sulphur occurs in its elemental
form in Nature. In this case it may be in
crystals, which are orthorhombic and usually
occur as octahedrons, with the upper and lower
ends truncated, either by a basal plane, or by a
lower octahedron, or by both. Incrustations and
compact masses are, however, much the commoner
mode of occurrence. The incrustations
are found mostly about volcanic regions, where
the sulphur has risen from the molten lavas as a
sublimate, and on cooling has been deposited
in crevices or on the adjacent surfaces. Irregular
masses of sulphur are often found where sulphide
minerals, like pyrite or galena have been decomposed
in such a way as to leave the sulphur
behind. The extensive beds of sulphur are usually
associated with gypsum, and are thought to
be the result of water, containing bituminous
matter, so acting on gypsum as to remove the
calcium and oxygen as lime, and leave the
sulphur. Finally many waters carry sulphates
in solution, from which the sulphur may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
precipitated by certain sulphur bacteria, making
thus incrustations on the bottom of ponds or lakes.</p>
<p>Sulphur is used for making matches, gunpowder,
fireworks, insecticides, in medicine, vulcanizing
rubber, etc. It is widely distributed,
however, most of the present world&rsquo;s production
is from deposits associated with the &ldquo;salt domes&rdquo;
of Texas and Louisiana. A &ldquo;caprock&rdquo; of gypsum
and anhydrite overlies many of these which often
contains elemental sulphur. Wells are drilled into
this, and the sulphur is melted by the introduction
of hot steam. This melted sulphur is then pumped
to the surface and run into molds.</p>
<p>Some of the best known localities are Sulphurdale,
Utah, Cody and Thermopolis, Wyo., Santa
Barbara Co., Cal., Humboldt Co., Nev., and about
the hot springs of the Yellowstone Park.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Ice">Ice</a>
<br />H&#8322;O
<br /><a href="#Plate_51">Pl. 51</a>
<br /><i>water</i></h3>
<p>Occurs solid as ice, snow and frost,
or liquid as water; hardness, 2;
specific gravity, .92; colorless to
white; luster adamantine; transparent on thin
edges.</p>
<p>Though we seldom think of ice, and its liquid
form, water, as a mineral, still it is one, and
perhaps the most important of all minerals, as
well as the most common. Ice melts at 32&deg; F.
and vaporizes at 212&deg; F., being then termed
steam. Because it is so common and liquid at
ordinary temperatures it acts as a solvent for a
host of other minerals, and is therefore the agent
by which they are transported from place to
place and redeposited in veins and beds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Not only does water act as a transportation
agent for minerals in solution, but is also the
agent of erosion and weathering. Water vaporizes
slowly when exposed to the air at all temperatures
above freezing, and so it is slowly rising
from the surface of the sea or lakes or moist
ground into the air, where it would accumulate
until the air was saturated, if the air would only
keep still and at a uniform temperature. The air
will hold a given amount of water vapor, which
is, for example, 17 grams per cubic meter when
the temperature is 68&deg; F., but at 59&deg; F. it will
hold only 12&frac12; grams, or at 50&deg; F. only 9 grams.
Thus the air is more or less completely saturated
at higher temperatures, and when the temperature
is lowered the air can not hold all it has
taken up, and it is precipitated in dew, rain or
snow, most often as rain. When the rain falls it
mechanically carries away, and more or less
slowly transports to other places particles of
rock, being thus the agent of erosion; and when it
is slowed down, as on entering the quiet water of
a lake or the sea, it drops the mechanically carried
sediment and makes sedimentary deposits.</p>
<p>Another very important and unique feature of
water is that on freezing it expands about &sup1;/&#8321;&#8321;th of
its former bulk, so that, as a result, ice floats,
and also wherever water in crevices is frozen, the
crevices are enlarged. In locations where this
freezing and melting take place repeatedly
throughout a year, there the breaking up of
rocks is rapid.</p>
<p>This is hardly the place to take up a complete
discussion of water, but its action as a solvent,
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
mechanically, and in freezing, melting, and
vaporizing is the basis of a large part of the
study of geology.</p>
<p>When water crystallizes, as in forming ice, it is
in the hexagonal system. It tends to twinning
and a snow-flake is made up of a large number of
twinned crystals, each diverging from the other
at 60&deg;. When ice is formed in the air or on the
surface of water it forms these complex and
beautiful multiple twins, of which but a couple
are suggested here. Beneath the surface the
hexagonal crystals grow downward into the
water, parallel to each other, making a fibrous
structure, which is very apparent when ice is
&ldquo;rotten,&rdquo; which is the time at which the surfaces
of the prisms are separating, because the molecules
leave the crystal in the reverse order to
which they united with it. Frost in marshy or
spongy ground will often show this fibrous growth
beautifully.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ROCKS</span></h2>
<p>Broadly speaking a rock is an essential part
of the crust of the earth, and includes loose material,
like sand, mud, or volcanic ashes, as well
as compact and solid masses, like sandstone and
granite. Rocks are aggregates of minerals,
either several minerals grouped together, as are
mica, quartz and feldspar to make granite, or
large quantities of a single mineral, like quartz
grains to make sandstone.</p>
<p>The rocks are most conveniently classified
according to their mode of origin, into three main
groups, igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
The igneous rocks are those which have solidified
from a molten magma, like lavas, granites, etc.
The sedimentary rocks are those which represent
accumulations of fragments or grains, derived
from various sources, usually the weathering
of other rocks, and deposited by such agents
as water, wind and organisms. Metamorphic
rocks are those which were originally either igneous
or sedimentary, but have been altered
by the actions of heat, pressure and water, so
that the primary character has been changed,
often to such an extent as to be obscured.</p>
<p>Rocks once formed in any of the above ways
are being constantly altered in character by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
various processes of nature. Those exposed on
the surface are weathered to pieces, and the fragments
are transported by wind or water to accumulate
elsewhere as sedimentary rocks. Those
buried deep beneath the surface are affected by
the high temperature and pressure of the depths
of the earth and thus metamorphosed. For instance
a granite exposed on the surface is slowly
weathered, some parts being carried away in
solution by the rain water, others less soluble
remaining as grains of quartz, mica or kaolin.
These are transported by water and sorted, the
finer kaolin being carried to still and deep water,
the quartz and mica accumulating in some lowland
as sand. This sand will in time be cemented
to a sandstone, later slowly buried beneath the
surface. If buried deep it will feel the effect
of the interior temperature, which increases as
one goes down at the rate of one degree F. for
every 50 feet. If this should be in a region where
folding and mountain-making takes place, the
material under the folds would be melted (because
of the relief from pressure which would
permit the high temperature to act freely) and
become igneous rock, either coming to the surface
as lava, or remaining below the surface and
making a granite or similar rock; while the
sedimentary material not melted but near
enough to the molten material to be affected,
would be metamorphosed, in this case to a quartzite.
Much of the interest and profit in studying
rocks, will come from the understanding which
they will give as to the history of that particular
part of the earth&rsquo;s crust where they are found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Igneous Rocks</span></h3>
<p>Igneous rocks are those which have formed
from material that has been melted, which involves
temperatures around 1300&deg; C.; or, if
there is water in the original material, temperatures
as low as 800&deg; C. will suffice. Considering
the increase of temperature to be a degree for
every 50 feet downward, this involves the rocks
having been at depths of 5 to 10 miles below the
surface. While at such depths the temperature
must be high enough to melt rocks, the great
pressure of the overlying rocks seems to keep
them solid; for we know that the center of the
earth is solid, as is shown by a variety of observations,
such as the rate at which earthquake waves
are transmitted through the earth, the lack of
tidal effects, etc. However, there is every reason
to believe that if the pressure is removed from
the rocks which are five to ten miles below the
surface, there is heat enough at those depths to
melt them. When the crust of the earth is
folded, as when mountain ranges are formed, the
areas under the arches or upward folds are relieved
of pressure. Then those rocks, which are
under the arches and are relieved, become molten.
The molten magma may well up and fill the
space beneath the arch where it would cool again
very slowly; or, if there is fissuring during the
folding, some of the molten material may be
forced out through the fissures and pour out over
the surface as lava. Another area in which pressures
may be locally relieved is in the region of
faulting, where the crust of the earth is broken
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
into blocks, between which there are readjustments,
some being tipped one way, some another,
some uplifted. Here again there would be areas
of relieved pressure and molten magmas would
form, some of them solidifying in place, others
rising to the surface.</p>
<p>The molten material is termed the <b>magma</b>,
and when it reaches the surface, great quantities
of water vapor and other gases escape: or these
gases may even escape from magmas which do
not reach the surface, rising through fissures.
As these hot vapors pass through the fissures,
they are cooled, and may deposit part or all of
their dissolved compounds in the fissure, making
veins. <b>Lava</b> is the magma minus the vapors.
Magmas vary greatly from place to place, indicating
that they are formed locally and do not
come from any general interior reservoir, as has
sometimes been suggested.</p>
<p>When the molten magmas escape to the surface,
they are termed <b>extrusive</b>, and as they
spread out in a layer this is termed a <b>sheet</b>. This
rise and overflow may be quiet, and from time
to time one outpouring may follow another making
sheet after sheet. Or after one outpouring,
the pressure below may cease for a time and
allow the lava to solidify and make a cap or
cover over the opening. Before more lava can
rise, this cover must be removed. This usually
happens in an explosive manner, the lava below,
with the increasing pressure exerted by its expanding
gases, finally exerting enough pressure,
so that the cover is broken, or shattered and
thrown in thousands of fragments into the air,
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
as happened at Mt. Pel&eacute;e on the Island of Martinique
in 1902. The fragments thrown into the
air are often termed volcanic ashes, though this
is not a good word for them, for they have not
been burned.</p>
<p>In case the molten magmas under the relieved
areas do not reach the surface they are termed
<b>intrusive</b>. Such magmas may remain in the
space under a mountain fold, or be forced in
fissures part way to the surface. When the magma
is forced into more or less vertical cracks and
there solidifies, and these are exposed by erosion,
they are termed <b>dikes</b>. Sometimes the magmas
have risen part way to the surface and then
pushed their way between two horizontal layers
of rock and there hardened, in which case they
are termed <b>sills</b>, when uncovered. The Palisades
along the Hudson River are the exposed edge of
a sill. Again the molten magmas may well up
and spread between two horizontal layers, but
come faster than they can spread horizontally,
and then the magma takes the form of a half
sphere, and the overlying layers of rock are
domed up over it. Such a mass is termed a
<b>laccolith</b>. In all these cases the mass of igneous
rock is only discovered when the overlying rocks
have been eroded off. The great mass of molten
magma under the arches of mountain ranges simply
cools slowly into a granitic type of rock.
These masses are exposed when the thousands of
feet of overlying rock are eroded off. When
these masses are exposed, if of but a few miles in
extent, they are called stocks, but, if of many
miles in length and breadth, they are <b>batholiths</b>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
and are very characteristic of the heart of
mountain ranges.</p>
<p>In all the above cases the exterior of the molten
mass cools first, and forms a shell around the
rest. The shell determines the size of the mass.
As the cooling continues into the interior, it also
solidifies, and as all rocks shrink on cooling,
cracks develop, separating the mass into smaller
pieces. There is usually no regularity about
these cracks and the mass is divided into blocks
from six inches to three feet in diameter. However,
in some cases, especially in sills and laccoliths
where the cooling is slower, the shrinkage
may be marked by a regular system of cracks
which bound the rock into more or less regular
hexagonal columns. The Palisades and the
Devil&rsquo;s Tower in Wyoming (See <a href="#Plate_52">Plate 52</a>) show
this structure. The Devil&rsquo;s Tower is the remnant
of a laccolith, all except the central core of
which has been eroded away. All of the above
terms have nothing to do with composition, but
refer entirely to the manner of occurrence.</p>
<p>While the igneous rocks are classified according
to their composition, the rate at which they
cooled has much to do with their texture, and
certain names apply to the texture. For instance
when the molten lava cools very rapidly, there is
no time for the formation of crystals, and the
resulting rock is glassy or non-crystalline. If the
cooling is slow as in large bodies, crystals have
time to form and grow to considerable size as
in granites. Between these all grades may occur;
and one classification of igneous rocks expresses
their rate of cooling, in such terms as the following.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p><b>Glassy</b>&mdash;lavas which have cooled so quickly
that they are without distinct crystallization,
such as obsidian, pitchstone, etc.</p>
<p><b>Dense or felsitic</b>&mdash;lavas which have cooled less
rapidly, so that crystals have formed, but in
which the crystals are too small to be identified
by the unaided eye, such as felsite or basalt.</p>
<p><b>Porphyritic</b>&mdash;magmas from which, in solidifying,
one mineral has crystallized out first and the
crystals have grown to considerable size, while
the rest have remained small.</p>
<p><b>Granitoid</b>&mdash;magmas which have solidified
slowly, so that all the minerals have crystallized
completely, and the component crystals are large
enough to be recognized readily, as in granite.</p>
<p><b>Fragmental</b>&mdash;a term applied to the fragments
which have resulted from explosive eruptions
of igneous rocks. These fragments may be loose
or consolidated. Volcanic ashes are typical.</p>
<p><b>Porous</b>&mdash;a term applied to the lava near the
upper surface, which is filled with gas cavities,
such as pumice.</p>
<p><b>Amygdoloidal</b>&mdash;is the term applied to porous
lavas, when the cavities have been filled by other
minerals, such as calcite or some of the zeolites.</p>
<p class="tb">In determining a rock, first decide whether it
is igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic. The
igneous character is recognized by its being either
glassy, or composed of masses of crystals irregularly
arranged, there being neither layering nor
bedding.</p>

<p>When it is located as igneous, turn to the key
on <a href="#Page_177">page 177</a> and decide as to which type of texture
is present. If glassy, the color, luster and
type of construction will place it. If the rock is
crystalline, first decide whether feldspar is present,
and if present, what type: then determine
the dark mineral, and lastly whether quartz or
olivine is present. In dense rocks the presence
of quartz may be determined by trying the hardness,
for none of the other constituents of igneous
rocks have so great hardness. For example, if it
is found that a rock is composed of orthoclase
hornblende and quartz, and the texture is granitoid,
it is granite: or if the rock is plagioclase feldspar
and pyroxene of any sort, it is gabbro, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Granite">Granite</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_53">Pl. 53</a></h3>
<p>The combination of orthoclase
feldspar (or microcline), quartz, and
either mica, hornblende or augite is
termed granite, if the texture is coarse enough so
the individual minerals can be recognized with
the unaided eye. The rock is light-colored because
the feldspar and quartz dominate. Accessory
minerals may be present such as apatite,
zircon, beryl or magnetite. Varieties of granite
are distinguished according to the dark mineral
present. When this is muscovite, it is a <i>muscovite-granite</i>;
when it is biotite, a <i>biotite-granite</i>; if
it is hornblende, a <i>hornblende-granite</i>; etc. The
size of crystals in granite varies widely. When
they are as small as &sup1;/&#8321;&#8322; of an inch in diameter, it
is termed fine grained; from &sup1;/&#8321;&#8322; to &frac14; of an inch,
it is medium-grained; when larger, it is coarse-grained.
In some cases the crystals may be over
a foot in diameter which is known as <i>giant
granite</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Originally granite was a great mass of molten
magma, which has cooled very slowly, having
been intruded or thrust up in great stocks or
batholiths beneath overlying rocks, which acted
as a blanket to prevent rapid cooling. These
overlying rocks, in their turn, have been acted
upon by the heat and metamorphosed. Granite
is particularly likely to have been formed under
mountain folds; so that, after the mountains
have been more or less completely eroded away,
the great masses of granite have come to the surface
to mark the axes of the ranges; and even
after the mountains have been wholly worn away,
the granite remains to mark the sites on which
they stood.</p>
<p>In the granite mass itself, there are often veins
and dikes, which probably resulted from the
shrinkage of the cooling granite, and they are
filled with a different and usually coarser granite
known as <b>pegmatite</b>. This pegmatite formed
from the residual magmatic material, so that as
some of the elements had already crystallized
out, the granite in these dikes is of different composition.
The extreme coarseness of these pegmatites
seems to be due to the character of the
mineralizing agents left in the dikes. In some of
these pegmatites the feldspar and quartz are so
intergrown, that when broken along the cleavage
surface of the feldspar, the quartz appears
like cuneiform characters, and this variety has
been given the name <i>graphic granite</i> (See <a href="#Plate_53">Plate 53</a>).</p>
<p>When granite is exposed to weathering, the
feldspar is the first mineral to be decomposed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
altering eventually into carbonates, quartz and
kaolin. The dark minerals are only slightly less
susceptible and they break down into carbonates,
iron oxides and kaolin. The original quartz
remains unchanged. Of these products the carbonates,
some of the iron oxide and a little of the
quartz are carried away in solution. The kaolin
and some of the iron oxide is in fine particles and
they are carried by the water until it comes to
the lakes or the sea. The quartz is left in coarser
grains, which are more slowly transported, and
deposited in coarser or finer sand and gravel beds.</p>
<p>Granites are widely used for building stone,
because they can be worked readily in all directions,
and have great strength and beauty. The
color depends largely on the color of the feldspar,
which may be white or pink, in which case the
granite will be gray to pink.</p>
<p>Granites occur throughout New England, the
Piedmont Plateau, the Lake Superior Region,
the Black Hills, Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada,
etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Syenite">Syenite</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_54">Pl. 54</a></h3>
<p>The combination of orthoclase
and either mica, hornblende, or
augite is syenite, the texture being
coarse enough so that the individual minerals can
be distinguished by the unaided eye. It differs
from granite in the absence of quartz. Syenite
is a light-colored rock with the feldspar predominating.
Minerals like apatite, zircon, or magnetite
may occur in it, as accessory minerals.
The foregoing would be an ideal syenite, but
usually there is some plagioclase feldspar also
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
present. If this occurs in such quantities as to
nearly equal the orthoclase feldspar, the rock is
termed a <i>monzonite</i>; if it predominates, the rock
becomes a diorite. The presence of quartz would
make this rock into a granite. Such a compound
rock has its type form, and when the proportions
of the component minerals are changed, it grades
into other types.</p>
<p>Like the granite, syenite is an intrusive rock,
which occurs in stocks and batholiths along the
axes of present or past mountain ranges. The
original magma welled up under the mountain
folds, where it cooled slowly, metamorphosing the
adjacent rocks. Like granite it has only been
exposed after a long period of erosion has removed
the overlying layers of rock.</p>
<p>Syenites are not as abundant as granites, but
they occur in the White Mountains, near Little
Rock, Ark., in Custer Co., Colo., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_QuartzDiorite">Quartz-Diorite</a></h3>
<p>The combination of plagioclase
feldspar, quartz and either mica or
hornblende makes quartz-diorite,
sometimes called <i>tonalite</i>. The above would
be the typical quartz-diorite, but there is usually
some orthoclase present, which if it equals
the plagioclase feldspar in amount makes this
into a monzonite; or if it dominates, it makes
the rock a granite. Quartz-diorite is darker
colored than the two preceding rocks, the dark
minerals being about as abundant as the light-colored
ones, such as feldspar and quartz. For
this reason the weight is also somewhat greater.</p>
<p>Like the others this is an intrusive rock, occurring
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
in stocks and batholiths, and indicative
of great molten masses thrust up under mountain
folds, and only exposed after the overlying rocks
have been weathered away. It is by no means an
abundant type of rock, but occurs at Belchertown,
Mass., Peekskill, N. Y., in the Yellowstone
Park, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Diorite">Diorite</a></h3>
<p>Plagioclase feldspar with hornblende
or mica, or with both, is
known as diorite. It is distinguished from
quartz-diorite by the absence of quartz. There is
generally some augite in it, but if this should be
equal to, or exceed the hornblende, the rock is
then a gabbro. There may also be a small
amount of orthoclase present, without taking this
rock out of the diorite class, but if the orthoclase
feldspar becomes dominant, then the rock is a
syenite. Thus there is gradation into other
groups in all directions. Apatite, magnetite,
zircon, and titanite often occur in small quantities
as accessory minerals. Generally the hornblende
is in excess of the feldspar, so that the
rock is a dark-colored one.</p>
<p>Diorites occur in much the same manner as
granites, being in stocks, batholiths or dikes,
and are often associated with granites and gabbros.
They are great intruded masses, associated
with mountain making, and like the preceding
rocks, cooled far below the surface, and have
been exposed only after great thicknesses of
overlying rocks have been weathered away.</p>
<p>Peekskill, N. Y., the Sudbury nickel district
in Canada, Mt. Davidson above the Comstock
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
Lode in Nevada, etc., are typical localities for
finding diorite.</p>
<h3><a id="species_OlivineGabbro">Olivine-Gabbro</a></h3>
<p>The combination of plagioclase
feldspar with augite (or any of the
pyroxenes) and olivine makes olivine-gabbro.
The feldspar is usually one of those
with considerable calcium in it, like labradorite;
and as the dark minerals predominate, the rock
is dark-colored. It is an intrusive rock, usually
in dikes or stocks, where it solidified far below
the surface, and was only exposed after the overlying
rocks were weathered off. It is by no
means an abundant type of rock, but is found in
the Lake Superior Region, and near Birch Lake,
Minn.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Gabbro">Gabbro</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_54">Pl. 54</a></h3>
<p>Plagioclase feldspar with any one
of the pyroxenes, most commonly
augite, is gabbro. There is a wide
range in the relative proportions of the two minerals
making gabbro. At one extreme are rocks
made entirely, or almost entirely, of plagioclase
feldspar, which are known as <b>anorthosites</b>, and
occur in parts of the higher mountains of the
Adirondacks like Mt. Marcy, in several places in
eastern Canada, etc. Then there are the typical
gabbros where the feldspar and augite are more or
less equally represented. At the other extreme
come those gabbros in which the pyroxene predominates,
in the most marked cases the feldspar
being entirely lacking, and the rock being termed
a pyroxenite. When the pyroxene of a gabbro is
either enstatite or hyposthene (usually the latter)
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
the gabbro is often called <b>norite</b>. Magnetite,
biotite, and hornblende may occur in small
quantities as accessory minerals.</p>
<p>Gabbro is a common intrusive rock, occurring
in stocks, batholiths, and dikes, and often varies
considerably in different parts of the mass. Like
granite the mass solidified far below the surface,
under some mountain fold, and has only been
exposed as the result of weathering away the
layers of overlying rock. Gabbros appear much
like diorites, but are distinguished by the fact
that the dark mineral is one of the pyroxenes,
instead of an amphibole or a mica. They are
widely distributed, being found in the White
Mountains, near Peekskill, N. Y., Baltimore,
Md., about Lake Superior, in Wyoming, the
Rocky Mts., etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Peridotite">Peridotite</a></h3>
<p>A rock made up of olivine and
augite (or any of the pyroxenes) is
peridotite. As it contains no feldspar, and both
augite and olivine are dark-green to black in
color, these rocks are always dark green to black
in color and of considerable weight. They are
usually rather coarsely crystalline. Peridotite is
usually associated with gabbro, making dikes
which lead from the main gabbro mass. Less
frequently it occurs independently, making up
an intrusive mass. Hornblende and mica may be
present in small quantities, as accessory minerals.</p>
<p>In general these are rather rare rocks, making
dikes connected with stocks or batholiths of
gabbro. Peridotite is found near Baltimore, Md.,
in Custer Co., Colo., in Kentucky, etc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<h3><a id="species_Pyroxenite">Pyroxenite</a></h3>
<p>This represents the extreme among
coarsely crystalline igneous rocks, a
whole mass made up of one mineral, and that
some one of the pyroxene group. If the mineral
can be exactly determined, the rock may be still
more definitely named. For instance if it is all
augite, then the rock would be called augitite.
Like the preceding rocks, pyroxenite is an intrusive
rock, usually found in dikes, which are
connected with gabbro, and it represents the segregation
of one mineral out of the gabbro, and
its solidification at one point. Hornblende,
magnetite and pyrrhotite may be present as
accessory minerals. This is not a common
rock, but it illustrates the fact that all possible
combinations do occur, if the circumstances
have warranted it. It is found
near Baltimore, Md., Webster, N. C., and in
Montana.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Rhyolite">Rhyolite</a></h3>
<p>This is a combination of orthoclase
feldspar, quartz, and either hornblende,
mica or augite in which the crystals are
of such small size that they can not be identified
with the naked eye. In composition it corresponds
to granite, but it is much finer in texture.
It differs from trachite by having quartz while
the latter has none. This can usually be determined
by trying the hardness as none of the other
minerals are as hard as 7. It is much harder to
distinguish it from dacite which differs only in
having plagioclase feldspar in place of the orthoclase,
and only the microscope will enable one to
make this distinction. Where the distinction
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
cannot be made these light-colored lavas are
often called <b>felsite</b>.</p>
<p>Rhyolite is usually an extrusive lava, occurring
in sheets, but sometimes it is intrusive, occurring
in sills, dikes, and laccoliths. In all these cases
the lava has solidified so rapidly, that the crystals
are tiny, and only the general effect of a
crystalline structure is distinguishable. Rhyolites
may occur with porphyritic structure, in
which case the presence of the larger feldspar
crystals will help to distinguish whether they
are orthoclase or not, making the determination
easier. The color of rhyolites is green, red or
gray, always a decided light shade.</p>
<p>Rhyolites are abundant in the western states,
as in the Black Hills, the Yellowstone Park,
Colorado, Nevada, California, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Trachite">Trachite</a></h3>
<p>The combination of orthoclase
feldspar with mica, hornblende or
augite is termed trachite, if the texture is dense.
It is usually an extrusive lava of light color
(green, red or gray), and corresponds in composition
to syenite. It can be distinguished from
rhyolite by having no quartz, and so nothing to
show a hardness above 5.5; but it is difficult to
distinguish it from andesite, which differs only
in having plagioclase feldspar in place of orthoclase.
It sometimes occurs with a porphyritic
structure, in which case the feldspar crystals are
usually large enough to be distinguished.</p>
<p>Trachites are not abundant in America, but
some are found in the Black Hills of South Dakota,
in Custer Co., Colo., and in Montana.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<h3><a id="species_Dacite">Dacite</a></h3>
<p>The union of plagioclase feldspar,
quartz, and either hornblende or
mica is termed dacite, if the texture is dense.
It is an extrusive lava, occurring mostly in sheets
and dikes. It corresponds in composition to
quartz-diorite. As the texture is dense it is
difficult to distinguish dacite from rhyolite, for
both have quartz and differ only in the character
of the feldspar, so it is quite common to use the
term felsite which does not distinguish between
the two, and only states that the rock is dense,
light-colored and extrusive. When, as often
occurs, the texture is porphyritic, and the feldspars
are the large crystals, then exact determination
is fairly easy.</p>
<p>Dacites are rather common, occurring on McClelland
Peak, Nev., in the Eureka district,
Nev., on Lassen&rsquo;s Peak, Calif., Sepulchre Mt. in
the Yellowstone Park, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Andesite">Andesite</a></h3>
<p>The union of plagioclase feldspar
with mica, hornblende or augite,
makes andesite if the texture is dense. The lack
of quartz, and so no mineral which has a hardness
of over 5.5, makes it possible to distinguish
andesite from dacite or rhyolite, but it is hard to
distinguish this rock from trachite, which differs
only on having orthoclase feldspar in place of
plagioclase. When the texture is porphyritic and
the feldspars are the large crystals, then it is easy
to make the distinction. Andesite gets its name
from being the characteristic lava of the Andes
Mountains, and is the commonest of all the extruded,
light-colored lavas, being the lava of
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
hundreds of flows throughout the western United
States.</p>
<p>The union of plagioclase feldspar and biotite
is the commonest type. Plagioclase with hornblende
or augite is less common, and, when they
do occur, they are usually distinguished as
<i>hornblende-andesite</i> or <i>augite-andesite</i>. Magnetite,
apatite and zircon may be present as accessory
minerals.</p>
<p>The lavas of Mt. Hood, Shasta, Rainier and
others of the volcanic peaks of the Cascade
Range, those at Eureka and Comstock in Nevada,
in the Yellowstone National Park, and
the porphyries of many peaks in Colorado, like
the Henry Mts., etc., which are exposed laccolithic
intrusions, are all andesites, as are many
more.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Basalt">Basalt</a></h3>
<p>The combination of plagioclase
feldspar with olivine and augite (or
any other pyroxene) makes a heavy, dark-colored,
black to dark-brown rock which, if its
texture is dense or porphyritic, is termed basalt.
This usually has more or less magnetite in it as an
accessory mineral, indeed the magnetite may be
so abundant as to be a component part of the
rock. This magnetite makes trouble for anyone
trying to use a compass on or about basalt rocks.
These are extrusive or intrusive rocks and correspond
in composition to gabbro.</p>
<p>Basalts are among the commonest of igneous
rocks, and are popularly designated &ldquo;<i>trap</i>,&rdquo; much
used as a road ballast on account of its toughness,
which is largely due to its dense texture. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
coast of New England is seamed with dikes of
basalt, and through the Adirondack and White
Mountains there are a host of these dikes. The
crests of such mountains, as the Holyoke Range,
the Tom Range, the Talcott Mts., East and West
Rocks at New Haven, etc., are all basalt sheets.
The Palisades, First Wachung and Second Wachung
Mountains of New Jersey are sills of
basalt. The Lake Superior region is crisscrossed
with basalt dikes. That greatest of all lava fields
the Columbia Plateau, covering over 200,000
square miles on the Snake and Columbia Rivers
in Oregon, Washington and Idaho, is all basalt.
So it goes all down through Nevada, New Mexico
and California.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Porphyry">Porphyry</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_55">Pl. 55</a></h3>
<p>This is a term which properly refers
to texture alone, indicating a
lava, which has cooled in such a
manner that one mineral has crystallized out of
the magma first and developed to a larger size,
while the mass of the material formed tiny crystals
in which the larger ones are embedded. The
large crystals are technically known as <i>phenocrysts</i>.
The surrounding mass of tiny crystals
is termed the <i>matrix</i>. This porphyritic structure
is especially characteristic of lavas which
have been extruded in large masses, and of
intruded lavas in such places as sills and
laccoliths.</p>
<p>The term porphyry today has the above precise
meaning. It is a much abused word, and
has had all sorts of meanings. In the past it was
first used to refer to lavas in general, then it came
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
to be applied to lavas which had been erupted
before Tertiary times, that is to all ancient lava
sheets. This idea soon proved incorrect, lavas
being of the same composition whether ancient
or recent. In the West the word is often colloquially
used today to designate almost every
kind of igneous rock occurring in sheets or dikes,
if in any way connected with ore deposits.</p>
<p>When the composition of a rock with porphyritic
textures can be determined, the name
due to the composition is coupled with that due
to texture, making such terms as <i>trachite-porphyry</i>,
<i>basalt-porphyry</i>, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Tuff">Tuff</a></h3>
<p>Tuff, a term not to be confused
with tufa on <a href="#Page_215">page 215</a>, is the name
used to designate the finer fragmental ejecta of
volcanic eruptions, which are also often referred
to as &ldquo;volcanic ash,&rdquo; but the word, ash, conveys
the false impression that the rock is a remnant
of something burned, and is therefore not a good
term. When first ejected, tuff is loose material,
but it is usually soon cemented to make a more
or less firm mass of rock, for which the term, tuff,
is still retained. In some cases, while still loose,
it is carried by streams to a distance and deposited
in more or less sorted and layered beds:
and the finer tuff is often carried by the winds
and laid down, at a considerable distance from
its source, in so called &ldquo;ash beds.&rdquo; In both these
cases, sedimentary characteristics have been
added to the tuff, and layering which is characteristic
of sedimentary deposits, is present.
These transported tuff beds are really sedimentary,
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
but as there is little change in the material,
they are referred to here and not again. These
tuff beds are not at all uncommon in the sedimentary
deposits of Tertiary age in the Rocky
Mountain region. The coarser material of
volcanic eruptions usually goes under the head
of breccia.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Breccia">Breccia</a></h3>
<p>This term is used to describe the
coarse fragmental ejecta of volcanic
eruptions. It is also used, in the section under
sedimentary rocks, in a broad sense to include
all angular unworn fragmental material, whether
of igneous or sedimentary origin. For this
reason, when dealing with igneous rocks, it is
usual to designate the fragments according to
their composition, making such terms as <i>trachite-breccia</i>,
<i>rhyolite-breccia</i>, etc.</p>
<p>While still loose (and also even when cemented
into beds of rock), it is customary to designate
the smaller fragments, from the size of a grain of
wheat up to an inch or two in diameter, as
<i>lapilli</i>; the larger fragments, from two inches
up to a foot or so in diameter, as <i>bombs</i>; and the
largest masses, often tons in weight, as <i>volcanic
blocks</i>.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Obsidian">Obsidian</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_55">Pl. 55</a></h3>
<p>Lavas, which have cooled so
quickly that crystals have not had
time to form, have a glassy appearance,
and are termed obsidian. If the color
is dark, due to the presence of large amounts of
those elements which make dark minerals, this
lava is termed <i>basalt-obsidian</i>. Obsidian is
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
characterized by its glassy texture, a hardness
around 6, and by breaking with a conchoidal
fracture, so called because the surface is marked
by a series of concentric ridges, something like
the lines of growth on a shell. Obsidians vary
greatly in color, but are usually red or green to
black, and translucent on thin edges. While
glassy, all the obsidians contain embryonic
crystals, which appear like dust particles floating
in the glassy matrix, or there may even be a few
larger crystals present, which are often arranged
in flow lines. Most all large masses of obsidian
have streaks or layers of stony material in them
where crystallization has set in, in a limited
way.</p>
<p>Near the upper surface, obsidians usually have
gas cavities scattered through them, and these
may be small and few, or large and numerous.
Indeed the cavities may be so numerous as to
dominate and give the rock a frothy appearance.
In this case, if the cavities are small and more or
less uniform, the rock is called <i>pumice</i>; if they
are larger it is <i>scoria</i>. If, as often happens
when the lava is ancient and has been buried
beneath other rocks, the cavities have been
filled with some secondary mineral, then the
lava is called an <i>amygdoloid</i>.</p>
<p>Obsidian is found in many localities, especially
where there are recent volcanoes, the most
famous places being the obsidian cliffs in the
Yellowstone Park, those near Mono Lake in
California, and many other localities in the
Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevadas, and the
Cascade Mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<h3><a id="species_Pitchstone">Pitchstone</a></h3>
<p>This is very like obsidian in
appearance, but differs in that the
glassy material contains from five to ten per cent
of water in its composition, the most obvious
effect of which is to make the luster resinous,
instead of vitreous, as is characteristic of obsidian.
The colors are commonly red, green or
brown. Pitchstone is associated with recent
volcanoes, and some fine specimens have come
from Silver Cliffs, Colo., and various parts of
New Mexico and Nevada.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Perlite">Perlite</a>
<br /><i>pearlstone</i></h3>
<p>Perlite is a glassy lava, containing
two to four per cent of water, which,
on cooling, has cracked into numerous
rounded masses, with a concentric structure,
reminding one of the layers of an onion.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Scoria">Scoria</a></h3>
<p>While lava is cooling, there is a
constant escape of gases, mostly
steam, and as these rise through the molten
mass they make cavities, near the upper surface,
that portion on top often becoming frothy. If
this solidifies quickly so that the gas cavities are
preserved it is scoria. When the gas cavities are
small and uniformly distributed, the rock is
called pumice, and often used as a scouring
agent. When the cavities are large and irregular
the term scoria is generally used. Molten lavas
may form various structures, according to the
conditions under which they cool, dripping
through cracks or from the roof of caves, which
often form where the molten lava escapes from a
hardened shell, and making stalactites, stalagmites,
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
etc. The very thin lava of the Hawaiian
volcanoes may even be blown by the wind into
fine threads, known as &ldquo;Pele&rsquo;s hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The presence of the gas cavities is so characteristic
of the upper surface of lavas which have
been extruded; that, where one is dealing with
older lavas, now buried beneath other rocks, this
fact helps to determine whether the mass is a
sheet, rather than a sill; for, in the case of the
sill, the lava was forced between layers of
sedimentary rocks, and the burden of the overlying
rocks did not permit the escape of steam
and therefore the upper surface of sills does not
have the scoriaceous structure.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Amygdoloid">Amygdoloid</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_56">Pl. 56</a></h3>
<p>When the upper surface of a lava
is filled with steam holes, and this
lava has been buried beneath other
rocks, the seeping waters slowly bring such
minerals as quartz, calcite and zeolites and fill
the cavities. Such a rock is known as an
amygdoloid. It is often confused with porphyry;
but, if examined closely, it will be seen
that the outlines of the gas cavities are rounded,
while the outlines of a crystal, like a phenocryst,
are always angular. This will be clear if
the amygdoloid on <a href="#Plate_56">Plate 56</a> is compared with
the porphyry on <a href="#Plate_55">Plate 55</a>.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Sedimentary Rocks</span></h3>
<p>To this class belong all those rocks which have
been laid down by water or wind, or are the
results of organic depositions. They include
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
loose material like sand or day, and also the
same materials, when cemented into more or
less solid rocks, like sandstone or shale. So long
as the material has not been altered from what
it was when laid down, the rock is termed
sedimentary.</p>
<p>In general the material of which these rocks
are composed comes from the weathering and
disintegration of other rocks. This does not
apply to the organic deposits, for each type of
which there is a peculiar mode of formation.
To illustrate the typical formation of sedimentary
rocks, we may look at the fate of a granite
when exposed. At once the surface is attacked
by changes of temperature, frost and rain. The
various minerals of the granite expand and contract
with every change of temperature, but each
component mineral has a different coefficient of
expansion under heat, so that minute cracks are
quickly formed between the minerals. Water
gets into these cracks and begins to dissolve the
minerals. Feldspar is the most easily attacked,
part of it being dissolved and carried away, a
small part changing to quartz, and by far the
largest part changing to kaolin. The dark
mineral is also attacked and partly dissolved,
and partly changed to kaolin and iron oxides.
The quartz resists solution almost completely.
Of these products the kaolin and iron oxides
are carried far away and deposited in still water.
The quartz and perhaps some of the dark mineral
are heavier and carried more slowly, being
deposited as sand. This happens to granite
everywhere, but in the regions where there is
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
frost the action is greatly hastened; for water gets
into the cracks and expands every time it freezes
and thus widens the cracks rapidly, which greatly
facilitates the entrance and movement of water
in the rock. In a similar way any original rock
will be disintegrated, and the residue, after the
soluble part has been carried away, becomes sand
or clay or mud.</p>
<p>Particles of quartz, kaolin, and lime, separately,
or mixed, loose or more or less cemented,
with accompanying impurities, make up the
great bulk of the sedimentary rocks. They
are usually arranged in layers, of varying thickness,
as they were laid down by water or the
wind. In the same way layered accumulations
which are either products of plants or animals,
or parts of the plants or animals, are considered
sedimentary, as for instance, coal, chalk, petroleum,
etc.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<h3><a id="species_Talus">Talus</a></h3>
<p>Where weathering is very active,
especially on or below steep mountain
slopes, a mass of loose, angular fragments
accumulates. This material is termed talus, a
term which refers only to the physical character
of the material, and not at all to its composition.
If weathering continues these fragments will be
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
further broken up into one of the finer grained
rocks, which the water can carry away and deposit
elsewhere. There is little or no layering in
talus. If the talus is not carried away but is
cemented where it was formed, the resulting
mass is termed breccia, but this is not very
commonly the case.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Breccia_rock">Breccia</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_58">Pl. 58</a></h3>
<p>The term breccia is used to cover
all those rocks which are composed
of angular fragments, of any composition,
and above sand in size, when they are
cemented into a solid mass, by any sort of
cementing agent. Here the term is used in its
broad sense, as compared with the way it was
used under igneous rocks.</p>
<p>Breccias may result from the cementing of
talus, but more often the breaking up of the
material into angular fragments was due to
other causes, such as crushing along a fault
plane, or in the movements involved in mountain
making. In such cases the breccia is of limited
extent, but may occur repeatedly in the same
neighborhood. Limestone, which has been
crushed and then recemented, often makes a
rock which takes a good polish and is used in
several localities as an ornamental stone in place
of marble, in fact often goes in trade circles
under the name of &ldquo;marble.&rdquo; The breccia
figured on <a href="#Plate_58">Plate 58</a> is such a limestone.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Soil">Soil</a></h3>
<p>Over most of the earth&rsquo;s surface
there is a covering of rock waste,
the product of weathering, some of which is
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
unassorted, and some of it sorted by water or
wind. This is all termed soil. It is an ever-moving
cover resulting from the decomposition
of the underlying rocks, to which have been
added in places layers of rock waste brought
from afar by the streams. Some soils are rock
waste which had been carried clear to the ocean
and deposited on the floor of the sea, and is now
above sea level, because the floor of the sea
has been elevated. Inasmuch as the underlying
rocks vary in composition, and as there are
areas of transported material, it is clear that
the composition of soils must vary from place to
place, both as to composition and texture.</p>
<p>Soils range from the finest, composed mostly
of clay, to coarse ones, composed of sand, gravel
or even boulders. Clay, the finest grained soil,
is composed of particles only about &sup1;/&#8321;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320;th of a
millimeter in diameter, of which it would take
720,000 billion particles to make a gram&rsquo;s weight.
Ordinary soils however have about 2 to 5 million
particles to the gram.</p>
<p>The average specific gravity of soil with the
usual amount of humus in it is from 2.55 to 2.75.
In this case however the specific gravity is of
less importance than is the volume weight. A
cubic foot of water weighs 62&frac12; pounds, that of
soil from 75 to 80 pounds, the extremes being
30 lb. for peaty soil and 110 lb. for calcareous
sand. The terms &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; and &ldquo;light,&rdquo; used
in agriculture do not refer to the volume weight,
for clay which is actually relatively light (70-75
lb. per cubic foot) is classed as a &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; soil;
while sand, of much greater actual weight, is
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
classed as a &ldquo;light&rdquo; soil. These terms as used
in agriculture refer to the ease with which the
soils are worked, and to their penetrability by
plant roots.</p>
<p>Soil is usually divided into an upper darker-colored
layer, termed loam, and into a lower,
lighter-colored layer, termed subsoil. The presence
of humus, resulting from the decomposition
of plant and animal remains is the factor which
darkens the color and distinguishes the loam; so
that loam is a complex of inorganic rock particles
plus more or less humus, colloid compounds,
bacteria, living plants and animals. The subsoil
is mainly rock particles. The distinctions
between these two layers break down in arid
soils, and often also in swampy regions.</p>
<p>It is this layer of soil on which the water of
every rain and flood works, picking part of it up
and carrying it along, step by step, to the sea.
Though the amount moved on any one day is
small, the sum of all the soil transported is
enormous, a large river carrying annual incredible
amounts. For instance the Mississippi
annually deposits in the Gulf of Mexico 476,900,000
metric tons (2204 lb. to the metric ton), of
which about a third is in solution. At this rate
it takes about 7000 to 9000 years to remove a foot
from over the whole drainage basin. This is
considerably slower than is the case of some
other rivers. While on the one hand soil is
being continuously carried away from the surface,
on the other hand it is being constantly
renewed from below, by the weathering action of
water, air and temperature.</p>

<h3><a id="species_Gravel">Gravel</a></h3>
<p>Gravel is a mass of loose fragments
of rock, which have been
rounded by water and deposited with little or no
sorting, so that larger and smaller pebbles and
sand all occur together. It is the deposit laid
down by comparatively fast water in inland lakes
or along the storm-beaten shores of the sea.
Where a swift stream enters quiet water, as
where it empties into a lake, there it quickly
drops its coarse material as gravel, usually thus
building a delta. Gravel also occurs in stream
beds, where for any reason the rate of flow is
checked. During the recent glacial period, the
ice sheet brought down great masses of unsorted
material, which was deposited as till, or in
moraines. Much of this was then picked up by
the running water and moved longer or shorter
distances, so that, all over the glaciated country
of the northern and eastern United States, there
are unusually large numbers of gravel deposits.
Gravels are all water laid, and usually show more
or less clearly the bedded or stratified structure.</p>
<p>The size of the component pebbles of gravel
ranges from great boulders to fine sand, and the
finer gravels grade into the coarser sands, the line
between gravel and sand being drawn at about
the size of a pea, the coarser being gravel, the
finer sand.</p>
<p>Gravel is widely used as ballast for railroads
and in making highways, because of its tendence
to pack well, while the hard pebbles resist wear.
It is also widely used in concrete work, bonding
in well with the cement, and making it go from
three to five times as far.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<h3><a id="species_Conglomerate">Conglomerate</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_58">Pl. 58</a></h3>
<p>Conglomerates are composed of
rounded pebbles and sand of varying
sizes, cemented together into a
solid rock. The pebbles may run up to boulders
in size, but they have all been more or less
rounded by water, and transported some distance.
The pebbles may all be of the same
composition, or may represent a variety of rocks.
When the pebbles are all, or most all, of one sort,
the resulting conglomerate is termed a <i>quartz-conglomerate</i>,
a <i>limestone-conglomerate</i>, a <i>gneiss-conglomerate</i>,
etc. So too the cementing material
varies in kind, silica, calcite and iron oxide being
the commonest. The color will depend on both
the component pebbles and the cement, sometimes
one dominating, sometimes the other.
There are some of the quartz- and limestone-conglomerates
which can be cut and polished to
make very handsome stone.</p>
<p>Conglomerates represent consolidated gravels,
and always indicate an aqueous origin, quite
often the delta of an ancient stream, or the
invasion of the sea over the land; so they have
become of importance to geologists in interpreting
past events.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Sand">Sand</a></h3>
<p>Sand is a mass of small rock particles,
from the size of a pea down to
&sup1;/&#8325;&#8320;&#8320; of an inch in diameter. The material may
be any sort of rock, or a mixture of two or more
kinds. Sand may be the result of the disintegration
of older rocks at the point where it
is now found, in which case the grains have the
shapes they had in the original rock; but more
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
often the sand grains have been transported
greater or lesser distances, and in the process
have been more or less rounded.</p>
<p>Those sands, which lie where they were formed
are called <i>residual</i>, and such sand is usually composed
of a mixture of angular grains, some harder
and others softer, such as quartz, feldspar, mica
and hornblende, all mixed together. Where the
sand has been transported, only the more resistant
minerals have remained, such as quartz,
magnetite, cassiderite, etc.; with which there
are at times rarer minerals, such as gold,
platinum, garnets or topaz. Such sands are
known as <i>gold-bearing</i>, <i>topaz-bearing</i>, etc.</p>
<p>The sands from different localities differ
greatly. The streams gather the rock particles,
and sort them according to the size, which the
water flowing at any given rate can carry.
When the water is slowed down, it drops all the
particles above the size which the new rate of
speed can handle. The grains of sand from the
bed of a stream are usually more or less angular.
The further they are carried, the more they are
knocked together and rounded; so that after
being carried to the sea, and then thrown up on
the beaches, they have been well rounded,
especially the larger grains. As the air is less
viscid than the water, sand which is transported
by the wind, is even more rounded; so that desert
sands show the most complete rounding, indeed
are even polished; and this is true even of the
smaller grains. It is the wind-blown, or desert
sands, which flow so evenly in an hourglass. Between
the angular residual sands and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
polished desert sands, there are of course all
grades. Glacial sands are angular or &ldquo;sharp&rdquo;
almost to the degree characteristic of residual
sands; and lake-shore sands are between river
sands and sea sands in the degree of rounding.</p>
<p>Sands made of particles of lime, <i>calcareous
sands</i>, are less resistant to wear than are those
of quartz. In regions where the water is &ldquo;soft&rdquo;
(free from lime), they do not last long, as they
are dissolved; but in a limestone region where
the water is &ldquo;hard&rdquo; (saturated with lime), the
grains are not so quickly dissolved and may
accumulate into beds of great thickness, as in
Florida. Along some shores of the ocean, there
occur &ldquo;green sands,&rdquo; which are ordinary quartz
sands mixed with the dark green mineral glauconite,
which is a potassium iron silicate, forming
on the ocean bottom as a result of the action of
decaying animal matter on iron-bearing clays
and potassium-bearing silicates, like feldspar.
This is particularly characteristic of some of the
sands along the coast of New Jersey.</p>
<p>In places, especially in the beds of rivers, there
occur &ldquo;quicksands.&rdquo; This is a deposit of fine
sand, mixed with a considerable amount of clay,
and saturated with water; so that it will not
support the weight of a man or an animal.
Much that goes under the name of quicksand is
a fluid mud, covered with a thin layer of sand.</p>
<p>Sand is used for a wide variety of commercial
purposes, and under these conditions gets various
trade names; for instance &ldquo;glass sand&rdquo; is a pure,
colorless to white, quartz sand, which is used as
one of the components in making glass. It must
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
be free from impurities, as these color the glass,
and much of the sand used for this purpose is
quartz, crushed to a fine sand-like condition.
&ldquo;Moulding sand&rdquo; is a rather fine-grained quartz
sand, with a small but very definite admixture of
clay, and this is used to make the moulds for
castings in foundries. &ldquo;Polishing sand&rdquo; is one
composed of angular fragments of quartz, usually
from stream beds or glacial deposits, or even
crushed quartz, and is used for cutting and
polishing marble, for sandpaper, and for polishing
wood and softer stones. There are many
other special uses, like building, ballast, filters,
furnaces, etc., in which quartz sand is used, being
screened if necessary to get the right sizes.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Sandstone">Sandstone</a></h3>
<p>When sand of any sort is cemented
so as to make a solid rock, it is
termed sandstone, which varies widely according
to the size, color and composition of the
grains, and also with the sort and amount of
the cement. When the size of the grains is
larger than that of a pea, sandstone grades into
conglomerate; when smaller than &sup1;/&#8325;&#8320;&#8320;th of an
inch, especially if mixed with clay, it grades into
shale. There are all grades of firmness, due to
the amount and kind of cement, ranging from
those which have little or no cement, but are
compact as a result of the pressure of the overlying
rocks, to those in which the cement has
filled all the pore spaces. In general there is
a considerable amount of space between the
grains of sand; so that a sandstone will absorb
large amounts of water, up to 25% of its bulk.
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
In moist climates where it freezes, this makes
many sandstones unsuitable for use as building
stones, as they are likely to spale, or chip off, as
is seen in the &ldquo;brown stone&rdquo; so much used in
New York City.</p>
<p>Sandstones are usually bedded rocks and are
relatively easy to quarry, and most of them are
not so firmly cemented, but that they can be
readily worked or cut into shape by the stone
cutter; and so, certain sandstones are very
popular for building stone or for trimming on
buildings, where they are not too much exposed
to the weather.</p>
<p>Sandstone gets a variety of names according
to the cement.</p>
<p><b>Siliceous sandstone</b> is cemented with silica
and usually very hard.</p>
<p><b>Calcareous sandstone</b> is cemented with lime
and usually rather soft.</p>
<p><b>Ferruginous sandstone</b> is cemented with one
of the iron oxides.</p>
<p><b>Argillaceous sandstone</b> is held together with
clay impurities, and is usually both soft and of
undesirable color.</p>
<p>According to their composition there is also a
number of varieties.</p>
<p><b>Arkose</b> is a sandstone composed of quartz and
feldspar grains, usually derived from the disintegration
of granite and not transported far.</p>
<p><b>Graywacke</b> is a sandstone composed of quartz,
feldspar, and some other mineral, like hornblende-augite,
etc., also derived from the disintegration
of granites and not transported far.</p>
<p><b>Grit</b> is a term applied to a coarse sandstone,
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
composed of angular quartz fragments, and used
to a considerable extent for millstones.</p>
<p><b>Flagstone</b> is a thin bedded sandstone, often
with mica, which splits easily and uniformly
along the bedding planes; so that it can be quarried
in large slabs. It was widely used for sidewalks
before the advent of concrete.</p>
<p><b>Freestone</b> is a thick-bedded sandstone, not
over hard, so called, because it can be worked
freely and equally well in all directions.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Clay">Clay</a></h3>
<p>Clay is a term used to describe a
mass of fine particles, the most
prominent property of which is plasticity when
wet. Clays range from masses of pure kaolin
to masses of kaolin and related minerals mixed
with as much as 60% of impurities, which may
be sand, lime, iron oxides, etc. The particles of a
fine clay range around &sup1;/&#8321;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320; of a millimeter in diameter,
while the impurities may be, and usually
are, of larger size, up to the size of sand grains.</p>
<p>All clays are of secondary origin, the result of
weathering, especially of feldspars, though clays
may also result from the weathering of serpentines,
gabbros, etc. In some cases after the
weathering of feldspar or limestones, the clay
may remain just where it was formed, as a
residual deposit; but, being so fine-grained, it is
usually transported by rain water or by the wind
and deposited somewhere else as a sedimentary
bed. The quiet waters of a lake are favorable
places for such deposits, and many clay beds
represent former lake bottoms. Impure clays
are often laid down on the flood plains of sluggish
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
streams. In fresh water the settling of the
clay is a very slow process, requiring days, or
when very fine, weeks, before the water wholly
clears. In salt water, however, the clay sort of
coagulates, the particles gathering together in
tiny balls, which settle rapidly, so that the water
is soon clear.</p>
<p>According to their mode of origin clays are
classified as residual, sedimentary, marine,
swamp, lake, flood-plain, eolian, etc. But when
their uses are considered a very different classification
is made, based mostly on their composition,
and we speak of China clays or kaolins, fire
or refractory clays, paving-brick clays, sewer-pipe,
stone-ware, brick, gumbo and slip clays.</p>
<p>The <b>kaolin</b> or <b>china clays</b> are residual clays,
usually resulting from the decomposition of
pegmatite dikes. They must be white when
burned, free from iron oxides, and fairly plastic.
A good deal of china clay is made by crushing
feldspar.</p>
<p><b>Ball clays</b> are sedimentary clays which remain
white when burned, are usually very plastic, and
free from iron oxides. They are mostly used in
the making of various sorts of china.</p>
<p><b>Fire clays</b> may or may not have iron oxides in
them, but they must be free or nearly free from
fluxing materials, such as lime, magnesia and the
alkalies (sodium and potassium compounds).
They may be more or less plastic, the essential
quality being their ability to withstand high temperatures
without fusing. Silica (as sand) tends
to diminish the refractory quality; so that a clay
otherwise suitable, if it has sand in it, becomes at
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
best a second grade fire clay. In coal mining
sections it is customary to term those beds of clay
either above or below the coal, &ldquo;fire clay&rdquo;; but
this is an unfortunate designation, for though
some of them are true fire clays, the most of them
are not.</p>
<p><b>Stone-ware clays</b> are those with considerable
sand and up to five per cent of fluxing materials.
They must be plastic enough to be readily
worked, and then burn to a dense body at comparatively
low temperatures.</p>
<p><b>Sewer-pipe clays</b> must be plastic, and carry
a considerable amount of fluxing material, as the
surface of the pipe is expected to vitrify in the
burning.</p>
<p><b>Brick clays</b> are low grade clays and vary greatly
in composition. The main requisites are that
they mould easily and bake hard at relatively
low temperatures with as little warping and
cracking as possible. As most clays shrink both
in the air drying and in the baking, sand is added
when the clay is being mixed. The color is
mostly due to the presence of iron impurities.
If there are iron oxides and little or no lime, the
brick bakes to a red color, but if there is an excess
of lime over the iron oxides, it bakes to a cream
or buff color, which on vitrifying turns green.</p>
<p><b>Paving-brick clays</b> range from surface clays,
to semirefractory clays, shale being often used.
The essential component is enough fluxing material,
so that the bricks shall begin to vitrify, or
fuse, at not too high temperatures.</p>
<p><b>Slip clays</b> are those with a high percentage of
fluxing material; so that, when baked at moderate
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
temperatures, the surface fuses into a glassy
brown or green glaze.</p>
<p><b>Adobe</b> is an impure calcareous clay, widely
used in the western United States for making
sun-dried bricks.</p>
<p><b>Gumbo</b> is a term applied to fine-grained plastic
clays which shrink too much in the burning to
be useful in manufactures. They can be burned
to make an excellent ballast for railroads and
highways. They are especially abundant in the
Middle Western States.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Loess">Loess</a></h3>
<p>This is the name given to a fine
grained homogeneous clay-like material,
which is a mixture of clay, fine angular
fragments of sand, flakes of mica and more or
less calcareous matter. It is usually without
stratification, and cleaves vertically, so that,
when eroded, it forms steep cliffs. Loess covers
great areas in the Mississippi Valley, in the Rhine
Valley, and in North Central China. By some
it is thought to be an accumulation of dust in
those regions where the prevailing winds were of
diminished velocity and where the grass or other
vegetation has served to catch and hold the
material; by others it is thought of as a river
and lake deposit; and by still others it is thought
to be due to the combination of the two modes,
wind and flood. The writer inclines to the first
view expressed.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Shale">Shale</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_59">Pl. 59</a></h3>
<p>When pure or impure clays, or
loess, are consolidated, they are all
grouped under the name shale. It
usually possesses a layered or stratified structure,
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
which makes it possible to split it into thin
layers. Of all the sedimentary rocks shale is the
commonest, and it may occur in all the places
where clay could occur, but the most widely
distributed shale is that which made the sea
bottom of former times and is more or less calcareous,
like the piece on <a href="#Plate_59">Plate 59</a>, in which bits
of shells are still visible. Shale has the same
wide variation in composition as has clay, the
various types being designated according to the
impurity which is present, as:</p>
<p><i>argillaceous shale</i>, made mostly of clay,</p>
<p><i>arenaceous shale</i>, shale with more or less sand
as an impurity,</p>
<p><i>calcareous shale</i>, or one with more or less lime
as an impurity,</p>
<p><i>ferruginous shale</i>, or one with iron compounds
as impurities,</p>
<p><i>bituminous shale</i>, or one colored black by the
presence of organic matter, remains of either
plants or animals.</p>
<p>While of no value as building material, shale
may be ground or crushed, and used as a substitute
for any corresponding clay, and thus many
manufacturers use shale in making fire-clay
products, bricks, tile, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Marl">Marl</a></h3>
<p>Where limestones or shells of any
sort have been pulverized, and
mixed with more or less impurities, especially
clay, the resulting unconsolidated mass is known
as marl. It is usually associated with marine
formations, and is the finer d&eacute;bris which has
settled on the ocean bottom well out from shore,
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
that is out beyond the sandy and mud deposits.
Finding it therefore usually indicates a sea
bottom recently elevated. It is very characteristic
of the southern coastal states, from
Maryland all along to Texas.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Limestone">Limestone</a></h3>
<p>Any mass of marl, or aggregate of
calcareous shells, corals, etc., which
has become consolidated is known as limestone.
It may, and usually does, have a wide range of
impurities, chief of which are clay, sand, iron
oxides, and bituminous matter, like plant or
animal remains. Pure limestone is white, but
due to impurities it ranges through grays, greens,
browns, to black, and even red, but this last is
rarer. It is easily identified by the presence of
calcium carbonate, which effervesces in hydrochloric
acid. It most often represents deposits
in fairly deep water on ocean bottoms of the past,
but there is also a wide range of limestones
which were formed in fresh water.</p>
<p>Limestone is often burned at temperatures
just above 900&deg; C, at which point carbon dioxide
goes off as a gas, and leaves calcium oxide, or
lime. When this is mixed with water it makes
calcium hydroxide, or slaked lime, which is
mixed with sand to give it body, and is used as
mortar. When exposed to the air, the slaked
lime gives up water, and takes back from the air
carbon dioxide, and again becomes calcium
carbonate with its original hardness. Limestone
is also used as one of the elements in all cements.
It is also considerably used as a building stone,
which, however, suffers in moist climates from
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
the solution of its lime by rains, but has stood up
very well in dry climates.</p>
<p>The varieties of limestone are mostly distinguished
according to their mode of origin,
some of them being as follows.</p>
<p><b>Bog Lime</b> is a white calcareous powdery deposit
on the bottom of ponds in limestone regions,
a deposit precipitated from solution by the
action of the plants inhabiting the ponds.</p>
<p><b>Coquina</b> (<a href="#Plate_59">Plate 59</a>) is the rock formed by the
rather loose consolidation of shells and shell fragments.
It is particularly characteristic of tropical
regions, and is very abundant near St.
Augustine, Fla., in which region it was, and still
is, cut into blocks and used for building stone.
In that mild climate it has stood very well.</p>
<p><b>Chalk</b> (<a href="#Plate_60">Plate 60</a>) is a soft fine-grained limestone,
formed in the ocean by the accumulation
of myriads of the tiny shells of Foramenifera,
which are single celled animals, living either a
floating life near the surface of the sea, or a
creeping life on the bottom. Chalk is composed
mostly of the shells of floating Foramenifera,
which when the animals died, settled to the
bottom and there accumulated, mostly at depths
of 600 feet or more. When the mass of unconsolidated
shells is dredged up from depths of
50 to 2000 fathoms, it is known as <i>Foramenifera
ooze</i>. Chalk beds are then indications of an
uplifted sea bottom. When consolidated, if
pure or nearly so, it makes a white chalk, and the
beds may be of considerable thickness, as is the
case of the famous cliffs near Dover on either
side of the English Channel. One of Huxley&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
most famous lectures is the one on chalk, found
in his <i>Essays and Lay Sermons</i>.</p>
<p><b>Coral Rock</b> is made by the cementation of fragments
of corals. The binding material, as in most
stones, is lime; and this sort of rock is associated
with coral reefs of either the past or the present.
One of the best illustrations of this being the
&ldquo;Dolomite Mountains&rdquo; in Tyrol. Coral rock,
like coquina, has been cut into blocks and used as
building stone, as in Bermuda.</p>
<p><b>Encrinal Limestone</b> (<a href="#Plate_60">Plate 60</a>) is a rock made
by the cementation of fragments of the skeleton
of crinoids. These animals belong to the group,
echinoderms, and are now extinct except for a
few so called &ldquo;sea-lilies.&rdquo; They were animals
with a central mouth surrounded by long, jointed,
flexible arms in multiples of five, and below this a
small body inclosed in calcareous plates, all at
the top of a long jointed stem. They lived in
the sea and in the earlier geological times must
have been very abundant; for their remains are
so common in places as to make whole layers of
limestone.</p>
<p><b>Hydraulic Limestone</b> is a fine-grained, compact,
yellowish limestone with from 13 to 17%
of sand, and some clay; which, when it is burned
at a temperature a little higher than that used in
burning lime, makes a product, that, while not
as strong as Portland cement, still like it sets
under water.</p>
<p><b>Lithographic Limestone</b> is a very fine-grained,
compact limestone with clay impurities, the
finest of the grain making it usable for making
the stone plates used in lithographic printing.
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
On slabs of this limestone figures are drawn in
reverse with a special crayon. Then the slab is
treated with acid, those parts which are not protected
by the drawing being etched away, while
the points protected by the drawing remain in low
relief. From this slab figures can then be printed.</p>
<p><b>Travertine</b> is a general name, applied to calcareous
deposits from fresh water lakes or
streams, and has been precipitated either as a
result of cooling or evaporation. Some travertines
are porous, while others are dense; some are
white, while others are colored, often beautifully,
by impurities in the water.</p>
<p>Porous deposits of travertine, when made on
grass or other like substances, are known as tufa
or <i>calc sinter</i>. Such masses are common around
Caledonia, N. Y., Mammoth Hot Springs in the
Yellowstone Park, etc.</p>
<p><b>Onyx marble</b> is a dense travertine, usually
formed as a result of the deposition of lime from
the water of springs. It is often banded, due
to the presence of impurities in the water at one
time, and their absence at other times.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Till">Till</a></h3>
<p>Till is an unconsolidated mass of
boulders, pebbles, sand and fine clay,
the unsorted material left behind by glaciers
when they melted. The boulders and pebbles,
while they show some wear, are not rounded like
those that have been transported by streams,
but have a more or less angular shape; and some
of them are polished or striated on one side,
where, while frozen in the ice, they were rubbed
along the bottom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>One of the most recent geological events in
America was the extension of the ice sheet, now
covering Greenland, down over north and northeastern
North America, until it extended as far
south as northern New Jersey, the Ohio River
and the Missouri River, and as far west as the
Rocky Mountains, but not over the Great Basin,
the Cascade Ranges or Alaska. This great
mass of ice, thousands of feet thick, moved from
two centers, one either side of Hudson Bay,
scraping up the loose soil, and grinding off the
exposed surfaces of the underlying rock. All
this material it carried southward, until the
melting along its lower margin equaled the rate
at which it advanced. When the melting was
faster than the advance the glacial sheet retreated.
At the southern limit of the advance
this d&eacute;bris was dropped, either making long ridges
(moraines) or while the ice was retreating, thicker
or thinner sheets. This deposited d&eacute;bris is till.</p>
<p>The soil, and especially the subsoil, in all the
regions formerly covered by the ice sheet, is made
up very largely of this till; which, where it is
undisturbed is often called &ldquo;hardpan.&rdquo; When
till is mixed with humus it becomes loam. This
mixture of material, varying all the way from the
fine powdered products of the ice grinding
to the great boulder it picked up and carried
south, is characteristic of this or any other
glaciated country. When this section of country
was settled, the boulders and stone were a hindrance
to cultivation, and were picked up and
piled into stone walls, which are one of the first
features to strike the eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<h3><a id="species_Tillite">Tillite</a></h3>
<p>When till is consolidated into solid
rock, it is known as tillite. In
several cases it has been found buried far beneath
the more recent sedimentary rocks; testifying
that there were other glacial periods beside the
last one which furnished the till.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Coal Series</span></h3>
<p>Disregarding minor constituents, the plants
are largely made up of cellulose, which is a
combination of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
(C&#8326;H&#8321;&#8320;O&#8325;). If this is heated in the air, where
there is plenty of oxygen, it disintegrates, or
burns, making carbon dioxide and water; but if
the heating is done where the oxygen is excluded,
as in a kiln, the hydrogen and oxygen
will be driven off and the carbon will remain
behind as charcoal. In Nature similar reactions
go on, but more slowly. Vegetable matter,
exposed to the air, disintegrates into carbon
dioxide and water, and there is no solid residue.
However, if the vegetable matter is under
water, which excludes the air more or less
completely including the oxygen in it, then
disintegration still takes place, but the products
formed are water, (H&#8322;O) marsh gas (CH&#8324;), and
some carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;), but a considerable
part of the carbon remains behind and
accumulates.</p>
<p>Thus in bogs, swamps and ponds, where dead
vegetation, especially that growing in the water,
piles up, the oxidation is incomplete; so that
there gradually accumulates on the bottom a
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
layer of brown to black mud, known as <i>peat</i>.
More plant remains are constantly being added,
and the layer may increase to several feet in
thickness. The decomposition is incomplete
and some oxygen and hydrogen remain, but the
carbon is in a constantly increasing ratio and
in proportion far above that in cellulose. In
the cold northern climates sphagnum moss is
the most efficient peat producing plant, but in
temperate and tropical climates the moss is
replaced by the leaves, twigs, trunks, etc., of
trees, bushes, and vines.</p>
<p>If these peat beds are buried beneath a layer or
layers of sediment, especially clay, the peat is
sealed up and oxidation stops almost entirely.
With the pressure of the superincumbent beds,
the peat becomes more and more compact, and
changes to a dark-brown or black color. It is
then known as <i>lignite</i>. If this lignite is buried
still deeper, with consequently more pressure
and more time, it changes into the still denser
black <i>bituminous coal</i>. This is as far as it will
go unless some new agent is added to the forces
already working.</p>
<p>The next step in the series of changes forming
coal is associated with mountain making. In
case the layers of rock containing beds of coal are
folded, and that presupposes at least a moderate
increase in heat, the bituminous coal is altered
to <i>anthracite</i>, which is still denser, and so hard
that it breaks with a conchoidal fracture.
Alteration may be carried a step still farther,
in case the rocks between which lie beds of coal
are effected by such high temperatures as accompany
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
metamorphism. Then all the associated
hydrogen, oxygen and moisture are driven
off, and only the carbon remains, which is
then known as <i>graphite</i>. All steps between
the stages especially designated occur. The
following represent steps only in the series of
changes.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Peat">Peat</a></h3>
<p>Peat is a mass of unconsolidated
vegetable matter, which has
accumulated under water, and in which the
original plant remains are still, at least in part,
discernible. It contains a large amount of
water, so that before it can be used as a fuel, it is
cut out in blocks, which are piled up and left
for a time to dry before using. It burns with a
long flame and considerable smoke. This country
is so well supplied with other fuels, that so
far peat has been but little used.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Lignite">Lignite</a>
<br /><i>brown coal</i></h3>
<p>Lignite is more compact than
peat, and is found buried to some
depth under layers of clay or sandstone.
It is dark brown to black in color, and
still retains pretty clear traces of the plants
from which it was derived. It also usually contains
a considerable amount of moisture, and
when this is dried out, it tends to crumble badly,
so that it is undesirable to handle it much, or to
ship it far, before using. It has a fair fuel value
and is fairly widely used; but it is very desirable
that some method be found, by which lignite
could be treated to obtain its by-products, and at
the same time make it more compact, so it would
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
not crumble with the handling incident to using
it in furnaces. There are extensive lignite
deposits in this country in North and South
Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New
Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.</p>
<h3><a id="species_BituminousCoal">Bituminous Coal</a>
<br /><i>soft coal</i></h3>
<p>This type of coal is compact, black
in color, and breaks readily, but does
not crumble as badly as lignite. It
contains considerable water, and still has some
hydrogen and oxygen compounds in it. Bituminous
coal is the product of plant remains
which have been preserved for long periods,
(millions of years), sealed from the air by the
overlying beds of rock. The pressure has made
it compact, and nearly all traces of the original
plants have disappeared.</p>
<p>Bituminous coal is our most abundant fuel,
occurring the world over in seams from less
than an inch in thickness to some over fifteen
feet thick. The United States is peculiarly
fortunate in the abundant and easily accessible
deposits of this type of coal, in Pennsylvania,
West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Missouri,
Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, Utah, and Colorado.</p>
<p>The volatile constituents, hydrogen and oxygen
compounds, of bituminous coal may be
driven off by heating the coal in closed ovens,
and the residual mass is known as <i>coke</i>, almost
pure carbon. This is distillation, and the ovens
in which this is done, without trying to save the
volatile products, are called bee-hive ovens,
while the more modern ovens which save the
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
by-products are called by-products ovens. A
ton of bituminous coal treated in the typical
by-products oven, will yield on the average 1410
lb. of coke, 7.1 gallons of tar, 18.9 pounds of
ammonia sulphate, etc., 2.4 gallons of light oils,
10440 cubic feet of illuminating gas, about half
of this last being used to furnish the heat for
the distillation. The coal-tar dye industry is
built on the tar thus produced. Toluol, benzol,
etc., come from the light oils; and half the gas
produced is available for household illumination,
etc. Coke is demanded, as it is a superior fuel
for melting iron ores, iron and steel, and is made
regardless of whether the by-products are used.
The coke thus produced is hard, clean, and
vesicular; but for some reason as yet unknown,
by no means all bituminous coal will produce a
coke which has this porous structure. These
latter are known as &ldquo;non-coking,&rdquo; and are of
little use to the steel industry.</p>
<h3><a id="species_CannelCoal">Cannel Coal</a></h3>
<p>This is a compact variety of non-coking
bituminous coal, with a dull
luster and a conchoidal fracture. It
contains the largest proportion of volatile hydrocarbon
compounds of any variety of coal; so that
when the supply of petroleum and natural gas
gives out, this will be one of the important
sources of obtaining substitutes. Cannel coals
occur in Ohio, Indiana, and eastern Kentucky.
This cannel coal owes its peculiar fatty nature
to the material from which it is derived, it being
supposed to have resulted from the accumulation
of the spores of lycopod trees, and their conversion
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
to jelly-like masses by bacteria in the
fresh-water marshes of those ancient days.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Anthracite">Anthracite</a>
<br /><i>hard coal</i></h3>
<p>Anthracite coal is hard, black,
has a luster, and breaks with a
conchoidal fracture. It contains but
a low percentage of volatile matter, and so burns
with a short flame, and less smoke, than is the
case with the other coals. It is always associated
with folded rocks, and appears to have
been formed as a result of the combined pressure
and the higher temperatures, which accompanied
mountain making. Still the temperature was
not high enough to metamorphose the adjacent
rocks. Most of our anthracite comes from
northeastern Pennsylvania.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Carbonite">Carbonite</a></h3>
<p>Carbonite is natural coke. It
occurs in coal seams which have been
cut by dikes or intrusions of igneous rocks, the
coal having been thus coked by natural processes.
It is not vesicular like artificial coke, for which
reason it is not useful as a fuel. Some carbonite
is found in the Cerillos coal field of New Mexico,
in Colorado, and Virginia.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Jet">Jet</a></h3>
<p>Jet is a dense variety of lignite, a
fossil wood of black color, which
takes a high polish and cuts easily into various
ornamental shapes. It has been used for
ornaments since early ancient times, beads of jet
being found in the early bronze period in England,
the supply probably coming from the
Yorkshire coast, whence the principal supply
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
comes even to the present day. In Switzerland
and Belgium it was used still earlier, even as far
back as the Pal&aelig;olithic age. Jet seems then
to have had a talismanic value, and to have been
worn to protect the owner. About 700 <span class="small">A.D.</span> crosses
and rosaries began to be made of jet, the custom
starting at Whitby Abbey, the material being
obtained nearby, so that it came to be known as
&ldquo;Whitby jet,&rdquo; and in the eighteenth century became
very popular. In recent times it has been
used mostly as jewelry suitable for mourning.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Amber">Amber</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_61">Pl. 61</a></h3>
<p>Amber is a gum which oozed from
coniferous trees and was petrified.
It is associated with lignite beds of
middle Tertiary age. It is usually pale-yellow
in color, but at times has a reddish or brownish
tinge, and is more or less transparent. It
occurs in rounded irregular lumps, up to ten
pounds in weight, though most pieces are
smaller; and is mostly picked up along certain
coasts where it is washed ashore by the waves.
Since the earliest records amber has been cast
up on the shores of the Baltic, and it was used by
peoples as early as in the stone age for ornaments
and amulets. It has been found among
the remains of the cave dwellers of Switzerland,
in Assyrian and Egyptian ruins of prehistoric
age, and in Mycen&aelig; in the prehistoric graves of
the Greeks, the first recorded reference to it being
in Homer, and the Greek name for amber being
<i>elektron</i> from which our word electricity comes.
All these finds were of Baltic amber which was
doubtless gathered and traded by those early
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
men. Even down to the present many men
make their living, riding along the shore at low
tide and hunting for the amber washed ashore
by the waves. As early as 1860 the German
geologists concluded that the source of the
amber must be lignite beds outcropping beneath
the sea level, and started mining for the
amber with fair success, so that today two types
of Baltic amber are distinguished, &ldquo;sea stone&rdquo;
which is washed ashore, and &ldquo;mine stone&rdquo;
taken from the mines. Beside the Baltic locality,
it is found along the shores of the Adriatic,
Sicily, France, China, and occasionally of
North America.</p>
<p>Some pieces of amber are found with insects
inclosed and preserved almost as perfectly as if
collected yesterday. They were apparently
entangled in the gum while still viscid and
completely embedded, before fossilization.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Petroleum Series</span></h3>
<p>Certain sedimentary rocks contain larger or
smaller quantities of natural gas, petroleum,
mineral tar and asphalt. These are compounds
of carbon and hydrogen, or hydrocarbons, and
range from gases to solids, each being a mixture
of two or more hydrocarbon compounds. The
crude petroleum may have either a paraffin base
or an asphalt base: in the former case, when the
gas, gasoline, kerosene, etc., have been removed
by distillation, the solid residue will be paraffin,
as in most of the Pennsylvania crude oils; while
in the latter case, the solid residue will be an
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
asphalt, as in most of the California and Texas
crude oils. In the case of the paraffin series all
the compounds belong to the paraffin group,
while the asphalt is due to the presence, in addition
to the paraffin group, of some of the benzine
series of hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>Petroleum is found in sands and shales, which
were originally deposited on ancient sea bottoms,
the shales generally being the real source of the
petroleum. The oil was once the fatty portion
of animal bodies (perhaps to some extent of plant
bodies), and was separated during decomposition
as a result of bacterial activity. Oil thus produced
is in tiny droplets, which have a great
affinity for clay. After being freed by the
bacteria, the oil droplets in muddy water attach
themselves to particles of clay, and as the clay
settles the oil is carried down with it, the two
eventually making a bituminous shale. In clear
water, or in water which is in motion, the oil
droplets rise to the surface and eventually distill
into the air.</p>
<p>The oil, or petroleum, may stay diffused
through the shales, in which case we have <i>oil-bearing
shales</i>, with sometimes as much as 20%
of oil. Were there but &sup1;/&#8321;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320; of a per cent of oil
in a layer of shale 1500 feet thick, this would
amount to 750,000 barrels per square mile which
is equal to a rich production from wells. When
the oil in shale amounts to three per cent or more,
it is commercially usable. There are large
stretches of petroleum-bearing rocks in New
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and all the
way out to the Pacific coast, some of them with
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
oil so abundant, that a blow of the hammer will
cause them to smell of petroleum.</p>
<p>In case these oil-bearing shales have been
heavily overburdened and compressed, the
petroleum may have been more or less completely
pressed out of them. Then the droplets
uniting have formed a liquid, which has moved
out from the shale, and gone wherever it could
find open spaces. Sandstones have frequently
offered their pore space, and as it filled, have
been thus saturated with petroleum. If the
sandstones were open to the air, or if fissures
extended from them to the surface, the oil has
escaped to the surface and evaporated into the
air. But in those cases where the sandstone
(or other permeable rocks) was covered by an
impervious layer, like a dense shale or clay, the
oil was confined below the covering layer of
rock. Crude oil is lighter than water; so that
when natural gas, petroleum and water were all
present in the rocks, the gas lies on top, the
petroleum next, and the water underneath.
With this in mind it is easy to see, that in slightly
folded or undulating layers of rock, the gas and
petroleum would be caught under upraised folds
and domes. This is the basis of prospecting for
oil.</p>
<p>If petroleum-bearing layers are depressed far
enough beneath the surface to be affected by the
high temperatures of the earth&rsquo;s interior, or have
been near volcanic activity, of course the petroleum
has been distilled by natural processes,
and at most only the residues, like paraffin or
asphalt, have remained. For this reason it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
impossible to find petroleum in igneous or metamorphic
rocks.</p>
<h3><a id="species_NaturalGas">Natural gas</a></h3>
<p>Natural gas is the lightest portion
of crude oil, and consists mostly of
marsh gas (&ldquo;fire damp,&rdquo; CH&#8324;) together with other
light hydrocarbons, like ethane (C&#8322;H&#8326;), ethylene
(C&#8322;H&#8324;), and some carbon dioxide and
monoxide. It is colorless, odorless, and burns
with a luminous flame. Mixed with air it is
explosive. It is found in sedimentary rocks,
mostly sandstones, either with or without petroleum.
Usually it is under considerable pressure,
and escapes with great force wherever
a hole permits. In time the gas all escapes
through the hole or well, and then the well
&ldquo;runs out.&rdquo; If petroleum is present under
the natural gas, the hole may become an &ldquo;oil
well,&rdquo; from which petroleum may be pumped,
until it in turn is exhausted. The end of an
oil supply is usually indicated by the appearance
of water in the well. Natural gas is mostly
associated with oil districts, as in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Illinois, Texas, California, etc.</p>
<h3><a id="species_PetroleumCrudeOil">Petroleum Crude Oil</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_61">Pl. 61</a></h3>
<p>Petroleum is a mixture of paraffin
compounds all the way from the
gases, through gasoline, kerosene,
lubricating oils, and vasoline to paraffin. In
some of the crude oils there is also an admixture
of compounds from the benzine series, in which
case, when all the volatile compounds have been
distilled off, an asphalt remains. The different
components of petroleum may be separated out
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
by heating the crude oil in closed tanks, and
drawing off the various substances at the proper
temperatures.</p>
<p>Petroleum occurs in sedimentary rocks of marine
origin, usually rocks which also contain the
shells of some of the animals, the soft parts of
which made the oil. To have been preserved
the millions of years since the petroleum was
first formed, the oil-bearing layers must have
been covered by some impervious layer of rock,
beneath the domes and anticlines of which the
oil has lain ever since. When such a dome or
anticlinal fold is perforated by a well, the
released oil flows to the surface with a greater or
less rush, according to the pressure. Wells may
keep flowing for 20 years, sometimes more, sometimes
much less. Those which flow with the
greatest pressure usually are relatively short
lived, at times lasting only a year or two. When
this easily obtained oil is exhausted, there is an
even greater supply to be obtained by the distillation
of the bituminous shales. Petroleum
never occurs in igneous or metamorphic rocks,
but is found in either sandstones or shales, in
places favorable for accumulation, all across that
great stretch of ancient sea bottoms, extending
from the Appalachian Mountains to the Rocky
Mountains, and in the Great Basin between the
Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada Range,
and also to the west of the Sierras.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Bitumen">Bitumen</a></h3>
<p>Where petroleum has escaped
through pores in the rocks, or by way
of fissures, and has come to the surface of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
earth, the lighter components, thus exposed to
the air, have vaporized and escaped, leaving
behind a more or less solid residue, which is
known as bitumen. If the escape was through a
fissure, the bitumen may have accumulated in
the fissure until it was filled, making vein bitumen.
Or the escape may have been so rapid that
the petroleum formed a pool or lake from the
surface of which evaporation took place. In
time such a pool will give off the gases and
volatile compounds, only a residue remaining
to make a pitch lake, like the one at Rancho Le
Brea near Los Angeles, or an asphalt lake like
the one on the island of Trinidad. On account
of their varying hardness and composition, some
of these bitumens have received special names; as:</p>
<p><b>Albertite</b>, a black bitumen with a brilliant
luster on broken surfaces, a hardness between 1
and 2, and a specific gravity a shade over 1.</p>
<p><b>Grahamite</b>, a black bitumen, which is brittle,
but has a dull luster, a hardness of 2, and a specific
gravity of 1.15.</p>
<p><b>Gilsonite</b> or <b>Uintaite</b>, a black bitumen with a
brilliant luster and a conchoidal fracture, a
hardness of 2 to 2&frac12;, and a specific gravity of
1.06.</p>
<p><b>Malta</b> is a semi-liquid viscid natural bitumen,
which has a considerable distribution in California.</p>
<p>The above varieties of bitumen look a good
deal like coal, but are easily distinguished by
their lightness (weight about half that of coal),
and the fact that with only moderate heat they
melt, and become a thick liquid like tar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<h3><a id="species_Guano">Guano</a></h3>
<p>Guano is the accumulation of the
excrement of birds (or of other animals
like bats) on areas so dry that, though
soluble, it is not leached and washed away. It
may also contain some of the bones and mummified
carcasses of the birds which died on the spot.
The greatest of these deposits are on several small
islands, just off the west coast of Peru, and now
&ldquo;farmed&rdquo; by the Peruvian government. In this
country there are no true guano beds, except a
few accumulations of bat guano in certain caves
of Kentucky and Texas, but these are not large
enough to become of commercial importance.</p>
<h3><a id="species_PhosphateRock">Phosphate Rock</a></h3>
<p>Phosphate rock is one composed
chiefly of calcium phosphate along
with various impurities, such as clay
and lime. It occurs in beds, irregular masses,
or as concretionary nodules in limestone or sand.</p>
<p>The bedded varieties are in the older sedimentary
rocks, in which the phosphate runs
from a small percentage up to as high as 85%.
Ultimately the phosphate came from either
animal excrement, or from bacterial decomposition
of animal carcasses and bones. In all the
beds it seems to be true that in the first instance
the phosphate was laid down as a disseminated
deposit in marine beds, usually limestones.
Later by the action of water leaching through
the rocks, the phosphate was dissolved, and then
redeposited elsewhere in a more concentrated
form. This may be either in the underlying
sandstones, but is more often in limestones,
replacing the original lime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>In these secondary deposits, if the phosphate
has been laid down in cavities, the resulting
phosphate will be in nodular masses. In the case
of the Florida and Carolina deposits, these
nodules have been freed from their matrix and
washed along the river beds, remaining as
pebbles in the river sands. The bed deposits
are mostly in Kentucky and Idaho. The commercial
use for such phosphate rocks is of course
the making of fertilizers.</p>
<h3><a id="species_DiatomaceousEarth">Diatomaceous Earth</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_62">Pl. 62</a></h3>
<p>Diatoms are tiny single-celled
plants living in uncounted millions
in the fresh and salt water. Each
diatom builds around itself two shells which fit
into each other like the cover and box of a pill-box,
and each shell is marvelously ornamented.
The shells are composed of silica of the opal
type. In size the diatoms range from &sup1;/&#8325;&#8320;&#8320;&#8320; of an
inch in diameter up to the size of a pin head, and
they live in such numbers that ordinary surface
waters have hundreds of them to the quart, and
where they are flourishing up to 250,000 in a
quart. When the plants die, or in order to
reproduce abandon the shells, these shells fall
to the bottom of the pond or the sea, and there
accumulate, often making a layer from a few
inches thick up to hundreds of feet in extreme
cases. If unconsolidated, this mass of tiny
shells is known as diatomaceous earth; but if
they are consolidated it is called tripolite, so
named because the first of them used commercially
came from Tripoli.</p>
<p>As the shells are tiny and uniform in size and
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
have a hardness of 6, the diatomaceous earth is
used to make a great variety of polishes, scouring
soaps, tooth paste, as a filler in certain kinds of
paper, in making waterglass, as an absorbent for
nitroglycerine, and as packing in insulating compounds,
where asbestos would otherwise be used.</p>
<p>Deposits of freshwater diatoms are found all
over the United States, usually in thin layers of
limited extent, especially in Massachusetts, New
York, Michigan, etc. The marine deposits of
diatoms are on a much larger scale, there being
beds of diatoms in Anne Arundel, Calvert and
Charles Counties, Md., up to 25 or 30 feet in
thickness. In Santa Barbara County, Cal.,
there is one bed 2400 feet thick and another 4700
feet thick, beside many other smaller ones. The
enormous former wealth of life indicated by these
great deposits may be suggested, when it is
remembered that it takes about 120,000,000 to
make an ounce in weight. They reproduce on an
average about once in five days, so that from a
single diatom the offspring possible under favorable
conditions would amount to over 16,000,000
in four months or over 60 tons in a year. Of
such an order is the potential increase of animals
or plants, no matter how small, if the rate of
reproduction is high.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Metamorphic Rocks</span></h3>
<p>Either a sedimentary or an igneous rock,
which has been altered by the combined activities
of heat, pressure and chemical action,
becomes a metamorphic rock. The process is
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
essentially one, during which the layers of rock
come under the influence of such temperatures
as are associated with the formation of granite
or lavas. Such material as is actually melted
becomes igneous rock, but adjacent to the
masses actually melted are other rocks which do
not melt but, according to the temperature, are
more or less changed, and these are the metamorphic
rocks. At a distance from the molten masses
the changes are minor, but close to the molten
magmas extensive changes take place. Though
not actually melted the rock near the heat center
may be softened, usually is, in which case pebbles
and grains or even crystals become soft and plastic,
and, as a result of the great pressure, are
flattened, giving the rock, when it cools again, a
striated appearance. At these high temperatures
the water in the rock and also some other
substances vaporize, and the hot steam and
vapor are active agents in making a great many
chemical changes. In some cases material like
clay is changed into micas, or chlorite, etc.; in
other cases the elements of a mineral will be
segregated and large crystals will appear
scattered through the metamorphic rock, such as
garnets, staurolites, etc.</p>
<p>If one studies a layer of rock both near and far
from the molten mass, all grades of change will
appear. For example, at a distance a conglomerate
maybe unaltered; somewhat nearer the
molten mass, the heat and steam may have softened
(but not melted) the pebbles and then the
pressure has flattened them as though they were
dough; and nearest the molten mass, the outlines
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
of the pebbles are lost, only a layered effect
remaining, and many of the materials have
changed into new minerals, like mica, garnets,
etc., but still the layered effect is preserved.</p>
<p>One of the effects of heat and pressure is to
flatten the component particles of the rock, so
that it tends to split in a direction at right angles
to the direction of the pressure, just as particles
of flour are softened and flattened under the
pressure of the roller; and then when the crust
is baked it splits or cleaves at right angles to
the direction in which the pressure was exerted
by the roller. This tendency to split is not to be
confused with either the layering, characteristic of
sedimentary rocks, nor the cleavage characteristic
of minerals. It has nothing to do with the
way the particles were originally deposited, nor
with their cleavage; but is due to the pressure,
and resembles the pie crust splitting, being
irregular and flaky. This is designated <i>schistosity</i>
if irregular and <i>slaty cleavage</i> if regular.
Schistosity refers to the flaky manner of splitting
into thin scales as in mica schists. Slaty
cleavage is more regular, this being due to the
fact that the material of which slate is made is
small particles of clay of uniform size.</p>
<p>The metamorphic rocks are generally more or
less folded, as they are always associated with
mountain making. These major folds are of
large size, from a hundred feet across to several
miles from one side to the other. Such folds may
also occur in sedimentary rocks or even in igneous
rocks and simply express the great lines of yielding,
or movement of the crust of the earth. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
addition to this there is minor folding or contorting
which is characteristic of metamorphic rocks
only. When the rocks were heated by their
nearness to the molten igneous magmas, they
must expand, but being overburdened by thick
layers of other rocks, there is no opportunity for
yielding vertically, so the layers crumple, making
minor folds from a fraction of an inch to a few
feet across. Such crumpling, which is so very
conspicuous especially where there are bands of
quartzite in the rock, is entirely characteristic of
metamorphic rocks. It is seen on hosts of the
rocks about New York City, all over New England,
and in any other metamorphic region.
<a href="#Plate_63">Plate 63</a> is a photograph of such a crumpled rock
which has been smoothed by the glacial ice.</p>
<p>The metamorphic rocks are the most difficult
of all the rocks to determine and understand,
because the amount of change through which
they have gone is greatest, but for this same
reason they offer the most interest, for the
agents which caused the changes are of the most
dramatic type of any that occur in Nature.
From one place to another a single layer of metamorphic
rock changes according to the greater
or less heat to which it was subjected, making
a series of related rocks of the same composition
but with varied amount of alteration. For this
reason in naming metamorphic rocks, a type is
named, and from that there will be gradations
in one or more directions, both according to
composition, and according to amount of heat
involved. If it is possible to follow a given layer
of metamorphic rock from one place to another
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
this is of great interest; for by this means, many
variations in the type will be found, both those
resulting from a different amount of heat, and
those due to the local changes in the composition
of the original rock.</p>
<p>One further consideration has to be kept in
mind. When a rock is metamorphosed the
high temperatures either drive off all water, or
the water may be used up in the making of some
of the complex minerals. When such a metamorphic
rock later comes near the surface and is
exposed to the presence of ground water, and
that leaching down from the surface into the
rocks, several of the minerals formed at high
temperatures will take up this water and make
new minerals such as serpentine, chlorite, etc.
They are always associated with metamorphic
rocks, and have been metamorphic rocks, but
since then have become hydrated, forming minerals
not at all characteristic of high temperature.</p>
<p>The following shows the relation of the
sedimentary and igneous rocks to their metamorphic
equivalents.</p>

<p>In working out the past history of any given
region, much of it is done on the basis of this
series of equivalents. The finding of limestone,
for instance, indicates that the given area was
at one time under the sea to a considerable depth,
that is from 100 to 1000 feet, but not ocean-bottom
depths which run in tens of thousands of
feet. Marble indicates the same thing, and so
one can go on through all these types of rock.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Gneiss">Gneiss</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_64">Pl. 64</a></h3>
<p>Gneiss is an old word used by the
Saxon miners, and is often very
loosely used. Here it is used in its
structural sense, and a gneiss may be defined
as: a banded metamorphic rock, derived either
from a sedimentary or an igneous rock, and is
composed of feldspar, quartz, and mica or hornblende,
and is coarse enough, so that the constituent
minerals can be determined by the eye.
It corresponds to a granite, or some sedimentary
rock like gravel or conglomerate.</p>
<p>Due to the action of pressure, all the gneisses
are banded, and the original constituent particles
or crystals are distorted. The lines of
banding may be long or short, straight, curved or
contorted. When the banding is not conspicuous,
the gneiss tends toward a granite.
When the banding is thin and the structure
appears flaky, the gneiss tends toward a schist.
The color varies according to the constituent
minerals, from nearly white, through red, gray,
brown, or green to nearly black. <a href="#Plate_64">Plate 64</a> shows
one gneiss which is in a less advanced stage, the
pebbles being simply flattened and the matrix
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
partly altered to micaceous minerals, and a
second gneiss which is so far advanced that the
original constituents are all altered to other
minerals and only the banded structure remains.
This latter type would have required but little
more heat to have completed the melting and
changed this to a granite.</p>
<p>Gneisses are very compact and have little or
no pore space in them. They are hard and
strong and resist weathering well, so that they
are widely used as building stone: but they are
not as good as granite for this purpose, as they
split more readily in one direction and can not
therefore be worked so uniformly as can
granite.</p>
<p>There are many varieties of gneiss, based
either on their origin, composition, or their
structure, as follows:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><b>Granite-gneiss</b> is one derived by metamorphism from granite.</dt>
<dt><b>Syenite-gneiss</b> is one derived by metamorphism from syenite.</dt>
<dt><b>Diorite-gneiss</b> is one derived by metamorphism from diorite.</dt>
<dt><b>Gabbro-gneiss</b> is one derived by metamorphism from gabbro.</dt>
<dt><b>Biotite-gneiss</b> is one composed of quartz, feldspar and biotite.</dt>
<dt><b>Muscovite-gneiss</b> is one composed of quartz, feldspar and muscovite.</dt>
<dt><b>Hornblende-gneiss</b> is one composed of quartz, feldspar and hornblende.</dt>
<dt><b>Banded-gneiss</b> is one in which the banded structure shows clearly.</dt>
<dt><b>Foliated-gneiss</b> is one in which there is thin irregular layering.</dt>
<dt><b>Augen-gneiss</b> is one which has concretionary lumps scattered through it.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Gneisses have a wide distribution over all New
England, most of Canada, the Piedmont Plateau,
the Lake Superior region, the Rocky Mountains,
the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Ranges.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Quartzite">Quartzite</a></h3>
<p>Quartzite is metamorphosed sand
or sandstone, and frequently grades
into one or the other. It is a hard compact
crystalline rock, which breaks with a splintery or
conchoidal fracture. It is distinguished from
sandstone by the almost complete lack of pore
spaces, its greater hardness and by its crystalline
structure. In practice it may be distinguished
by the fact that a sandstone in breaking separates
between the grains of sand, while a quartzite
breaks through the grains.</p>
<p>Some quartzites are almost pure quartz, but
others contain impurities of clay, lime or iron,
which were in the original sandstone. These
alter in the metamorphism to such accessory
minerals as feldspar, mica, cyanite, magnetite,
hematite, calcite, graphite, etc. The color of
quartzite when pure is white, but may be altered
to red, yellow, or green by the presence of these
accessory minerals.</p>
<p>On account of the difficulty of working the
quartzites, they are not much used in building,
though they are very durable. When crushed
they often make excellent road ballast, or filling
for concrete work. The pure varieties are sometimes
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
ground and used in the manufacture of glass.</p>
<p>According to the accessory mineral, the following
varieties may be distinguished; chloritic-quartzite,
micaceous-quartzite, feldspathic-quartzite,
etc.</p>
<p>Quartzites are common in the New England,
the Piedmont Plateau, and Lake Superior metamorphic
regions, and also in many western
localities.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Schist">Schist</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_65">Pl. 65</a></h3>
<p>Schist is a loosely used term, but
is used here in its structural sense.
It includes those metamorphic rocks
which are foliated or composed of thin scaly
layers, all more or less alike. The principle
minerals are recognizable with the naked eye.
In general schists lack feldspar, but there are
some special cases in which it may be present.
Quartz is an abundant component of schists; and
with it there will be one or more minerals of the
following groups: mica, chlorite, talc, amphibole
or pyroxene. Frequently there are also accessory
minerals present, like garnet, staurolite,
tourmaline, pyrite, magnetite, etc.</p>
<p>All schists have the schistose structure, and
split in one direction with a more or less smooth,
though often irregular, surface. At right angles
to this surface they break with greater or less
difficulty and with a frayed edge. As they get
coarser, the schists may grade into gneisses,
losing their scaly structure: while on the other
side, as the constituent minerals become finer
and so small as to be difficult of recognition,
schists may grade into slates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>The varieties of schist are based on the mineral
associated with the quartz; as mica-schist,
chlorite-schist, hornblende-schist, talc-schist, etc.</p>
<p>The color also is due to the constituent minerals
other than quartz and ranges widely, mica-schists
being white to brown or nearly black,
chlorite-schists some shade of green, hornblende-schists
from dark green to black, talc-schists
white, pale-green, yellowish or gray, etc.</p>
<p>Schists are found all over the same regions as
gneisses and quartzites, <i>i.e.</i>, New England
(especially good exposures of schist being seen
about New York City), the Lake Superior region,
Rocky Mountains, etc. Beside these regions
where it occurs native, there are boulders of
schist all over the glaciated areas of eastern
and northern United States.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Slate">Slate</a></h3>
<p>Slate is a metamorphic rock which
will split into thin or thick sheets,
and is composed of grains so fine as to be indistinguishable
to the unaided eye. The cleavage
is the result of pressure during metamorphism,
and has nothing to do with the bedding or
stratification of the sedimentary rock from
which it was derived. The original bedding
planes may appear as streaks, often more or less
plicated, and running at any angle with the
cleavage. If these bedding streaks are abundant
or very marked, they may make a slate
unsuitable for commercial uses. The slaty
cleavage may be very perfect and smooth so
that the rock splits into fine sheets, in which case
it is often used for roofing slate; but by far the
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
greater part of the slates have a cleavage which is
not smooth or perfect enough so that they can be
so used. Slates are the metamorphic equivalents
of shales and muds, and represent the effect of
great pressure but with less heat than is associated
with schists or phyllite, and consequently with
less alteration of the original mineral grains.</p>
<p>The color ranges from gray through red, green
and purple to black. The grays and black are due
to the presence of more or less carbonaceous
material in the original rock, the carbon compounds
having changed to graphite. The reds
and purple are due to the presence of iron oxides,
and the green to the presence of chlorite.</p>
<p>While the particles of slate are so small as to
be indistinguishable to the unaided eye, the use
of thin sections under the microscope shows that
slate is composed mostly of quartz and mica,
with a wide range of accessory minerals, like
chlorite, feldspar, magnetite, hematite, pyrite,
calcite, graphite, etc.</p>
<p>According to their chief constituents slates
may be distinguished as argillaceous-slate or
<i>argillite</i>, bituminous-slate, calcareous-slate, siliceous-slate,
etc.</p>
<p>Slate will be found here and there in the metamorphic
areas of New England, the Piedmont
Plateau, the Lake Superior region, and in many
places in the west.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Phyllite">Phyllite</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_66">Pl. 66</a></h3>
<p>Phyllite is a thinly cleavable,
finely micaceous rock of uniform
composition, which is intermediate
between slate and mica schist. In this case the
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
flakes of mica are large enough to be distinguishable
to the eye, but most of the rest of the
material can only be identified with the aid of a
microscope. It is mostly quartz and sericite.
Phyllite represents a degree of metamorphism
greater than for slate, but less than for schist;
and it may grade into either of these other rocks.
Garnets, pyrite, etc., may be present as accessory
minerals. The color ranges from nearly white to
black, and it is likely to occur in the same places
as do slates.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Marble">Marble</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_66">Pl. 66</a></h3>
<p>This is a broad term, and includes
all those rocks composed essentially
of calcium carbonate (limestones) or
its mixture with magnesium carbonate (dolomite),
which are crystalline, or of granular
structure, as a result of metamorphism. It
takes less heat to metamorphose a limestone, and
for this reason the marbles have a more crystalline
structure than most metamorphic rocks;
and they do not have the tendency to split or
cleave which is so characteristic of most metamorphic
rocks. It is only when there is a large
amount of mica present that the typical schistosity
appears. Commercially the term marble is
used to include true marble and also those
limestones which will take a high polish; but in
this book, and geologically speaking, no rock is a
marble unless it has crystalline structure.</p>
<p>Marbles range widely in color according to
their impurities. Pure marble is white. Carbonaceous
material in the antecedent limestone
is changed to graphite in the metamorphic
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
process, and makes the marble black, but appears
usually in streaks or spots, rather than in
any uniform color. An all black &ldquo;marble&rdquo; is usually
a limestone. The presence of iron colors the
marble red or pink. Chlorite makes it green, etc.</p>
<p>Various accessory minerals are common in
marbles, such as mica, pyroxene, amphibole,
grossularite among the garnets, magnetite, spinel,
pyrite, etc., through a long list.</p>
<p>Because it cuts readily in all directions and
takes a high polish, marble is widely used as a
building stone. In the moist climate of the
United States it suffers in being soluble in rain
water when used on the outside of a building: but
for interior decoration it furnishes some of the
finest effects.</p>
<p>The largest marble quarries are developed in
Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania,
Georgia, Alabama, Colorado, California,
and Washington.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Steatite">Steatite</a>
<br /><i>Soapstone</i></h3>
<p>Steatite is a rock composed
essentially of talc, which is associated
with more or less impurities,
such as mica, tremolite, enstatite, quartz,
magnetite, etc. It is found in and with metamorphic
rocks, and is a rock which has been
modified by hydration from a metamorphic
predecessor. It was probably first a tremolite
or enstatite schist, in which, after the metamorphic
rock came into the zone where ground
water exists, the tremolite or enstatite was
altered to talc, the impurities remaining much
as they were in the first place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>It is bluish-gray to green in color, often soft
enough to cut with a knife, and has a greasy
feel. It is very resistant to heat and acids; for
which reasons it has proved very useful commercially
in making hearthstones, laundry tubs,
and fire backs; and, when powdered, in making
certain lubricants. The Indians, in the days
before Columbus, took advantage of the ease
with which it is cut, to make from it large pots
for holding liquids, which are today among the
greatest treasures in collections of Indian relics.
They also carved pipe-bowls and various ornaments
and amulets from soapstone.</p>
<p>It is found in Vermont, Massachusetts, New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and
California.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Serpentine_Rock">Serpentine</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_67">Pl. 67</a></h3>
<p>Pure serpentine is the hydrated
silicate of magnesium, as described
among the minerals on <a href="#Page_138">page 138</a>.
Serpentine rock is serpentine with more or less
impurities, such as pyroxene, amphibole, olivine,
magnetite, chromite, calcite, magnesite, etc.
It often also contains mica and such garnets as
pyrope, as accessory minerals. Serpentine, like
steatite, always occurs in and with metamorphic
rocks, and was originally a metamorphic rock,
but has since been changed by the hydration of
its silicates, when it came into the zone in which
ground water is present. In the first instance it
was some sort of shale, clay and dolomite, which
was metamorphosed to an amphibole or pyroxene
schist. When this was exposed to the action of
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
ground water, the amphibole or pyroxene minerals
were changed to serpentine, resulting in a
rock composed mostly of serpentine, but retaining
the impurities which were in the metamorphic
rock, and perhaps adding to them such
amphiboles and pyroxenes as were not altered
during the hydration process. The above is
the commonest type of serpentine rock. It can
and sometimes has been formed in a similar
way from an igneous predecessor, by the hydration
of its silicate minerals. In this latter case
the serpentine would not be a modified metamorphic
rock, but a modified igneous one. It is
a case where such a rock as a diorite or a gabbro
is exposed to ground water and the pyroxene
present altered to serpentine. A serpentine
formed in this way would be a very impure one.</p>
<p>Serpentine rock is used as an ornamental
stone for interior decoration, because it takes a
high polish and has pleasing colors, various
shades of green. It is however decidedly soft
and will stand very little exposure to weather,
and it is also filled with seams which make it
difficult to get out large slabs.</p>
<p>Serpentine rock occurs fairly commonly in the
metamorphic belt of New England and the
Piedmont Plateau, and in some of the western
states, especially California, Oregon, and
Washington.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Ophiolite">Ophiolite</a>
<br /><i>Ophicalcite</i></h3>
<p>This name is given to marbles
which are streaked and spotted with
serpentine. They are a mixture of
green serpentine and a white or nearly white
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
calcite, magnesite or dolomite in variable
proportions.</p>
<p>Ophicalcite occurs in and with metamorphic
rocks, and represents an impure limestone which
has been metamorphised, the lime becoming
marble, and the impurities becoming such silicates
as pyroxene, amphibole, or olivine. This
metamorphic rock has then come into the zone
of ground-water and the silicate minerals have
been changed by hydration to serpentine. Ophicalcite
is then a metamorphic rock, in which
secondary chemical changes have since taken
place. It may have a wide range of accessory
minerals present, such as magnetite, chromite,
pyrope among the garnets, olivine, etc. Verde
antique is a trade name for one of the ophiolites.</p>
<p>While not abundant, ophicalcite is in good
demand as an ornamental stone for interior
work; for it takes a high polish, and is beautiful;
but, on the other hand, it will not stand exposure
to the weather for the calcite is soluble, and there
are numerous seams and cracks in it making it
difficult to obtain large slabs.</p>
<p>It occurs in Quebec, Canada, in the Green
Mountains of Vermont, and in the Adirondack
Mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MISCELLANEOUS ROCKS</span></h2>
<p>There are a few rocks which do not fit into
any of the three groups described, such as concretions,
geodes, meteorites, etc., and they are
gathered together here. There is also one type
of rock, which really belongs among the minerals,
but is likely not to be so recognized at first
glance, and that is the material filling veins.
These last are sometimes designated &ldquo;vein
rocks,&rdquo; but are really massive deposits of one,
two or more minerals, and should be referred
to the minerals when found.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Concretions</span></h3>
<p>In the sedimentary rocks there frequently
occur inclusions of a nature different from the
surrounding rock. In shape they are usually
rounded, nodular, spherical, discoidal, ovate,
flattened, elongated or ring-shaped, or combinations
of the foregoing, making often curious and
fantastic forms. In size they range from a
fraction of an inch in diameter to several feet
through. When broken, they may show a
nucleus, around which more or less concentric
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
layers have formed, or neither nucleus nor
concentric structure may be visible. The layered
structure of the surrounding rock in some cases
continues right through the nodular mass.
These structures are called concretions, and
their formation in all cases is at least due to
similar reactions.</p>
<p>In general the concretions differ from the
surrounding rock in composition, but are usually
composed of some one of its impurities, of lime
in the clays or silica in limestones, of iron oxide
in sandstone, etc. They seem to have originated
as a result of the solution of the minor mineral,
and then its redeposition around some center or
nucleus. In many cases the nucleus is organic,
such as a leaf, a shell, a bone, etc., so that when
the concretion is split, in its center will be found
the perfect imprint of the leaf, or the shell of a
mollusk, or a bone of a higher animal, sometimes
a whole skeleton. Again the nucleus may
be inorganic like a grain of sand; and in still
other cases no nucleus can be found, though
there was probably one in the beginning. What
has happened is somewhat like the case of accessory
minerals in igneous and metamorphic rocks.
A layer of sediment was laid down, including in
it, here and there, something foreign to the run
of the rock. Later when the water leaches
through this rock, impregnated with lime for
instance, it comes to the point where a leaf is
decomposing. The products of the leaf decomposition
are different from what is already
present in solution, and may precipitate some
of the lime in that neighborhood. As long as leaf
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
decomposition continues the precipitation in
that region will continue and increase the size
of the concretion. This sort of action accounts
for many of the concretions, especially those
about organic remains. In some other cases
where there is no nucleus, as the flint in chalk,
what has taken place is that the small amounts
of silica in the lime have been dissolved, and
then around some center has constantly been
added more and more non-crystalline silica
until a mass of flint has accumulated. There
may be a considerable variety of ways to account
for different concretions, but in all cases solutions
of one mineral have come in contact with
solutions of a different kind, and precipitation
about a center has resulted.</p>
<h3><a id="species_ClayStones">Clay stones</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_68">Pl. 68</a></h3>
<p>Of all the concretions these are
perhaps the commonest, being found
in the clays of all types and in many
regions. They are made of lime and precipitated
around some nucleus of foreign matter. The
shapes vary widely, usually discs, flattened ovals
or even rings, in most all cases however flattened.
This is indicative of the water moving
though the clay more freely in some layers than
others. Often clay stones occur so abundantly
that two or more have grown together making
fantastic shapes, sometimes resembling animals,
and all sorts of fancied but unrelated objects.
As the clay stones have grown the clay has not
been pushed aside, but has been incorporated
within the concretion; so that when a concretion
is dissolved in acid, it yields not only the lime,
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
which is its reason for being, but also a large
amount of clay.</p>
<p>Claystones are found in clays most anywhere,
usually occurring in certain layers and being
absent from others.</p>
<h3><a id="species_LimeConcretions">Lime concretions</a></h3>
<p>These are found mostly in shales
which carry a high percentage of
clay as impurities, and are characteristic
of the older geological formations, especially
ancient sea bottoms. They are likely
to have as a nucleus some shell, fish bone, or a
leaf, which when the concretion is split, reveals a
wonderfully preserved portion of an animal or a
plant, which was buried millions of years ago.
The lime concretion is closely related to the
claystone, and is really a claystone which has
been buried so long that the surrounding matrix
has changed to a shale instead of remaining
clay.</p>
<p>One of the most famous localities for these
lime concretions is Mazon Creek, Illinois, where
thousands of these concretions have been picked
up and split to study the organic remains included.
The commonest objects found are fern
leaves, like the one on <a href="#Plate_68">Plate 68</a>. But about once
in a thousand times they inclose a spider or
insect, and once in ten thousand times the skeleton
of an amphibian, which is of especial interest,
as here have been thus found the remains of the
very earliest of the land animals. These remains
were inclosed in these concretions during
the coal age, probably 50,000,000 years
ago, and once inclosed all the hard parts have
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
been as well preserved after that long interval,
as they were immediately after being inclosed
in the concretion. Lime concretions range from
less than an inch in diameter to several feet
through. They are not confined to shales, but
sometimes occur in sandstones, in this case also
usually having as a nucleus either a shell, or the
bone, or bones, of some animal.</p>
<p>They are likely to be found anywhere in the
limestone belt, from the Appalachian Mountains
to the Rocky Mountains, or in the Great Basin,
or on the Pacific Coast. Often they have been
mistaken for turtles and other objects. A good
many of the cases where the head or body of
animals &ldquo;petrified with all the flesh&rdquo; are reported,
it is one of these concretions which has a
shape sufficiently like the part described, for the
imagination to construct the rest.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Septeria">Septeria</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_69">Pl. 69</a></h3>
<p>Septeria are lime concretions,
which, after they had formed, have
shrunk and developed a series of
cracks running through them in all sorts of directions,
and since then the cracks have been
filled with various minerals, such as calcite,
dolomite, and siderite. These make a series of
veins which intersect the concretion, in a sort of
network. Septeria are mostly of considerable
size, ranging from six inches in diameter to
several feet through. They are characteristic of
the shales of ancient sea bottoms, especially
those of Devonian age in New York, and Pennsylvania,
and those of Cretaceous age in Wyoming,
Montana and the Dakotas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<h3><a id="species_FlintConcretions">Flint concretions</a></h3>
<p>The silica in limestones is often
segregated into nodular masses of
varying sizes, to make concretions of
flint. Such masses have grown in the limestone,
and, while growing, have either pushed away, or
dissolved the adjacent limestone, so that the
flint nodule is pure silica. They are especially
characteristic of the chalk beds, and of ancient
limestones which formed on the floor of the sea,
like the Helderberg Limestone of New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, etc. When thin sections
are cut through these flints, and examined under
the microscope, many remnants of the shells of
plants and animals are still recognizable. A
nucleus is seldom found, but in some cases there
is a fossil in the nodule about which the concretion
doubtless formed. The spicules of sponges,
shells of diatoms, and of radiolarians seem to
have contributed most of the material from
which flint concretions are formed. In addition
to the silica there are frequently inclosed in these
nodules the horny jaws of various sea worms,
and a host of spiny balls the relationships of
which are still unknown.</p>
<h3><a id="species_SandstoneConcretions">Sandstone concretions</a></h3>
<p>There are two types of sandstone
concretions, first those which are
cemented with lime, and second
those cemented with iron oxide. The concretions
bound by lime are especially characteristic
of sandstones which were laid down as river
deposits, either in the channels or on the flood
plains, and also the sandy deposits resulting
from wind deposition. In these cases the concretions
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
will mostly be found to have formed
around some organic nucleus, most frequently
about a bone, or group of bones, of some ancient
animal. In this country they are mostly found
in the arid and semiarid sections of the West,
where the present day wind erosion exposes the
harder parts of bluffs, etc.</p>
<p>The second type of sandstone concretion is
the one in which the cement is most often
limonite, less often hematite. These concretions
are less dense than the lime ones, and in some
cases the limonite is only precipitated at a distance
from the nucleus, which has resulted in the
formation of a hollow shell, filled with loose
sand. This is especially characteristic of certain
concretions, found in a gravel or coarse sand in
the region of Middletown, Del.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Oolites">Oolites</a></h3>
<p>In large bodies of water like the
sea and some larger lakes we find
concretions which have formed, or are still
forming, about tiny grains of sand, which are
still being moved about by the waves and currents.
In such cases not only are great masses of
concretions formed but they have very clearly
marked the concentric layering, which shows
that they have increased in size, sometimes more
rapidly and sometimes more slowly. Where
great masses of such concretions have formed the
resulting rock appears like a great mass of small
eggs, whence the term oolite. The cement may
be any one of several substances, but lime, silica,
and hematite are perhaps the most common.
Here and there are found larger or smaller masses
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
of this oolite. In some cases it would appear
that the material was precipitated by the action
of bacteria. Such for instance is probably the
origin of the Clinton iron ore, a bed of oolitic
hematite, extending from New York State all
down the Appalachian Mountains to Alabama.</p>
<h3><a id="species_Pisolite">Pisolite</a>
<br /><a href="#Plate_69">Pl. 69</a></h3>
<p>When the concretions, formed in
exactly the same manner as in the
case of oolite, are of a size bigger
than a pea, then the rock is known as pisolite.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Other Concretions</span></h3>
<p>Though less abundant concretion may form
from still other substances. Hematite has been
mentioned, and when concretions are made of
this material, either they have been deposited by
bacteria, or were formed as limonite and the
water of crystallization of this latter mineral
driven off.</p>
<p>Manganese concretions are found on the floor
of the ocean at maximum depths, and brought to
the surface by dredging.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Geodes</span></h3>
<p>Geodes are nodules, which, when broken open,
are found to be hollow and the cavity lined with
one or more minerals. They represent a special
case of minerals in a cave. There was in the
first place a cavity in the surrounding rock,
usually of sand or clay. As the water leached
through the surrounding rock, it became saturated
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
with one or more minerals and then coming
into the cavity, deposited the minerals, either as
crystals, or as a non-crystalline mass, lining the
cavity. Thus the inside is often a beautiful
cluster of bristling crystals, or it may be simply
layer on layer of chalcedony of any color.
Before this process had gone so far as to completely
fill the cavity, erosion had dislodged
the mass, and it has been found. One usually
recognizes that it is a geode by the fact that it
is far too light to be a solid rock, and then it
may be carefully broken. They are characteristic
of certain formations; so that having accidentally
broken the first one, others can be
carefully opened to display the beauty of the
interior. The geode illustrated on <a href="#Plate_70">Plate 70</a> is
lined with quartz crystals, but near by were
found many others, some of which had chalcedony
and some jasper as a lining. Such crystallined
nodules are usually called geodes so long
as they occur in a softer matrix so that they are
easily dislodged, and until they reach a size of
three or four feet in diameter.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Pebbles</span></h3>
<p>When picked up either from brook beds, sea
beaches, or the open plain, there are few forms
of rock which tell a story of the past more completely
than do pebbles; and any one, who enjoys
reading a story written in form, structure and
composition, will find in pebbles one of the most
satisfying and at the same time testing exercises.
The story may be complex or simple according
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
to what has happened to the parent rock, and
to that is added what happened since the pebble
left the ledge where it was a part of a great mass.
One must not forget to take into consideration
where the pebble was found and the character
of its associates. This sort of exercise is recommended
to all interested in rocks. It will yield
something upon first trying, and more on prolonged
study; and the fullness with which it is
done will test one&rsquo;s knowledge of the meaning of
rocks as nothing else will do. As a sample of this
sort of exercise let us take the two pebbles illustrated
on <a href="#Plate_71">Plate 71</a>.</p>
<p>The upper one is a common quartz pebble
picked up in a New England brook bed. Such
pebbles are common all over the country formerly
covered by the glacial ice sheet. It is crystalline
quartz, but the individual crystals are not distinguishable,
and such quartz is typical as the
filling of veins. It therefore goes back to a time
when the rocks were fissured, probably in connection
with the folding accompanying mountain
making far to the north in Canada. Into
the fissures thus formed seeped the water which
had been leaching through the adjacent rocks,
and it was saturated with silica which it had
dissolved from those rocks. In the open fissure
the quartz was deposited as crystals, which
grew finally filling the fissure and crowding each
other so that all the faces were obliterated. The
quartz vein was complete, but it must have been
far below the surface of the ground. Time must
have passed, thousands of years of it, until, in
the weathering away of the mountain system,
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
the many feet of overlying rock were removed
and this vein was brought to the surface. As
the quartz is harder than the adjacent rocks, the
vein soon projected as a ledge. The effect of
changes of temperature in alternately expanding
and contracting the rocks developed cracks, into
which water worked its way, and then the breaking
was hastened by the expansion which takes
place when water freezes, and in exposed regions
is so effective, because the freezing and thawing
are so often repeated. Finally an angular
fragment of quartz was dislodged and lay on the
surface, resistant to the solvent power of the
rain. In this case this happened just before the
advance of the great ice sheet. When that came
to the place where the fragment lay, it was
picked up along with all other loose material and
partly shoved in front of, but probably mostly
carried frozen in the ice, and journeyed one, two,
three hundred, perhaps a thousand miles. This
took many years for the ice moved only a few
feet a day. Finally however it came to the point
where the ice melted as fast as it advanced, and
our quartz fragment was dropped at the front
of the ice sheet along with other great masses of
till. Here there was abundant water, partly
from the melting of the ice, and partly from the
storms which must develop where there are such
contrasts in temperature, as there would be over
the ice, on one hand, and over the bare land in
front of the ice on the other hand. A torrent
picked up our fragment and started it on a second
journey, banging against other stones as it
rolled along down the stream bed, every time it
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
struck another stone bruising the corners which
soon became rounded. Thus from time to time
during high water the quartz fragment, becoming
rounder every time it moved, journeyed down
stream, until it came to the point where the
stream emptied into a lake. Here the current
was checked and the stone dropped to the bottom
along with other larger stones to make the delta
at the mouth of the stream. There it lay as long
as the lake existed, and would be lying now,
but that in New England a tilting movement of
the land tipped the north end of the lake up and
the water all ran out. Then the stream began to
flow over its own delta and in time of freshet
tore a channel down through the old delta carrying
the pebble still further down, until it came
to the level stretch which represented the old
lake&rsquo;s bottom and there it dropped the pebble
in its bed. And there it was found and picked
up to become the pebble which told the above
story of its life, and to repeat it as often as anyone
will look at it with a seeing eye.</p>
<p class="tb">The second pebble is quite a different one.
It was picked up in a gravel bank along a railroad
cut, just at the foot of Mt. Toby in Massachussetts,
and the writer has used it many times
to test his students, to see if they could read the
story which it tells.</p>
<p>It consists of two sorts of rock, the one, angular
fragments of a hornblende schist, the other,
a fine-grained granite filling all the spaces between
the fragments of schist, even in cracks
less than a quarter of an inch wide. The schist
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
is the older rock and in its first appearance
represents a deposit of mud (clay and sand) on
the floor of the ocean, well out from the shore,
and somewhere off to the east of Mt. Toby,
perhaps ten miles, perhaps more, from the place
where it was found. This was back in early
Pal&aelig;ozoic times, millions of years ago.</p>
<p>This deposit was buried by further layers of
sediment on the sea bottom and cemented into a
shale. Then during a mountain making period
the region was folded, and the sediments were
altered by the combined pressure and heat, our
layer of rock becoming a hornblende schist.
After that happened considerable time must have
passed, but just how much is not indicated by
the pebble, before another period of disturbance
took place, during which this deep seated schist
was faulted, and shattered to fragments along
the line of breaking. This accounts for the
angular fragments. Then into the fissure thus
formed was pressed a molten magma, which while
liquid enough to flow and be squeezed into every
opening could not have been very hot; for not
even the corners of the schist fragments are
melted or altered, so as to appear any different
from the mass of the schist. The molten magma
cooled rather slowly, making a fine-grained
granite. This must all have taken place far
below the surface, or the magma would have
cooled into a felsite or dense lava.</p>
<p>Again a long time must have elapsed, while
the rock overlying our piece was eroded away,
so it could come to the surface. Just about the
time it did come to the surface, the Connecticut
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
Valley was formed by a great block, 95 miles
long by fifteen to twenty miles wide, dropping
down six or eight thousand feet (probably not
all at once but by one or two hundred feet at a
time) between two north and south faults. This
took place in the Triassic Period. Of course the
streams then began to wash sand and stones of
all sizes into the hole. Our pebble was one of
these. While still an angular fragment, lying
perhaps ten miles east of the Connecticut Valley,
a stream started it moving, and as it rolled along
the brook bed, it was battered and rounded to its
present shape, and finally tumbled over a waterfall
to the bottom of the great hole, which had
been formed as described above. Here with
other stones it formed part of a coarse gravel,
coarsest near the sides of the hole, and finer
toward the middle; for the material was further
distributed in the bottom of the valley. Our
stone stayed pretty near the side and was soon
buried beneath hundreds of feet of similar material.
The leaching water dissolved enough iron
rust so that this acted on the lower layers as a
cement and bound the whole mass into a conglomerate.</p>
<p>Here for some millions of years our pebble
rested, while above it was piled sand and gravel
and a couple of sheets of lava, until the hole was
filled, and our pebble was near the bottom of the
mass. Later movements of the land raised the
whole region, fully six thousand feet, and erosion
went on for other millions of years. The conglomerate
and sandstone wore away faster than
the metamorphosed rocks on either side of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
filled valley, so that a new valley, the present
Connecticut Valley, came into existence.</p>
<p>When our pebble finally came near to the
surface on the side of Mt. Toby (a mound of
conglomerate which somehow was protected
and wore down a little less rapidly than the
conglomerate on either side of it), it was just
about the time of the glacial period. The great
ice sheet went over the mountain removing all
the loose material and some more of the solid
conglomerate. This brought our pebble to the
surface, but too late to be moved by the ice.
However as soon as the ice left the Mt. Toby
region, the rains fell, and in the further weathering
of the conglomerate, the cement holding our
pebble in place was dissolved and it was freed.
At once a tiny brook started it rolling down the
side of the mountain, a brook so small that when
the pebble reached the foot of the slope it did
not have power to carry it further. Here there
gathered a fan-shaped mound of such pebbles,
known as an alluvial fan. It rested here not
over a couple of thousand years, when the Central
Vermont R. R. cut a groove through the
fan, using the material for ballast, and here the
pebble was found and brought home.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Meteorites</span></h3>
<p>Meteorites can hardly be called common, but
there is always a chance of finding one, and their
interest is so great, that none should escape
because unrecognized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>Meteorites are visitors to the earth from space,
and they bring to us knowledge of the composition
of planets and solar systems, other than
our own. It is of interest to note, that while
they have brought to us some combinations of
elements which do not occur in the earth, still
they have not brought any element with which
we were not already familiar. They are popularly
known as &ldquo;falling&rdquo; or &ldquo;shooting stars,&rdquo;
though of course they are not stars, but only
small masses of matter which are entirely invisible
until they come inside our atmosphere.</p>
<p>In space there are many small (compared
with the size of the earth) chunks of matter, each
pursuing its solitary way around the sun, or
wandering through space along paths entirely
unrelated to the sun. From time to time one of
these passes near enough to the earth, so as to
be influenced by its attraction, and then comes
rushing toward it at tremendous speed, 20 to 30
miles per second. As soon as it comes into the
atmosphere, even the very attenuated atmosphere,
a couple of hundred miles above the
surface, friction heats the surface of the meteor
until it glows, and by that light we see the so-called
shooting star, often with a trail of luminous
matter streaming out behind. Of course in
using this term &ldquo;shooting star,&rdquo; we understand
the meteor is no star, for they are bodies as big
as our sun, shining at distances billions of miles
away.</p>
<p>As the meteor rushes through the atmosphere
it may all burn up, no large fragment reaching
the earth&rsquo;s surface. The luminous matter
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
streaming out behind is material which has
melted and dripped off the main mass. As this
oxidizes and cools, that part which did not
become gaseous will finally fall to the earth as
fine dust. When however a meteor actually
falls to the earth, its surface is still hot, though
probably there has not been time enough for
much heat to be transmitted to the interior.
At any rate they do not show any alteration due
to this cause. On landing and sometimes before
they land meteors break into two or more pieces.
When found the surface always shows the effects
of the heat generated by the friction of passing
through the air, the surface being smoothed, and
covered with stream lines and melted out pits
and hollows, and the outer surface consisting of
a thin crust, making an appearance, which once
seen, can hardly be mistaken.</p>
<p>There are two types of meteorites, those made
wholly or largely of iron with some nickel, and
appearing like great chunks of iron, and those
which are stony and resemble a granite boulder.
In collections the first sort, <i>i.e.</i> iron meteorites,
are most abundantly represented, because most
easily recognized when found. They consist of
masses of iron and nickel with small amounts of
other elements, ranging in size from the Cape
York meteorite, which fell in northern Greenland
in 1894 and was later brought by Peary to the
American Museum, and weighs some 36 tons,
down to small grains as small as a grain of wheat.
The largest one which has fallen in the United
States was the Willamette meteorite weighing
some 15 tons, and falling 19 miles south of Portland,
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
Oregon. These and all iron meteorites have
the iron in crystalline form which is readily seen
if the meteorite is cut, and the surface thus made
polished, then etched with acid, which is put on
and quickly washed off. Every meteorite has
its particular pattern, as illustrated on <a href="#Plate_72">Plate 72</a>,
and by these patterns can be identified. Meteorites
have a high value and are eagerly sought by
certain large institutions and collectors. Since
the crystalline structure is so characteristic of
each fall, when a new meteorite is found, it is
usually cut in two, and one part retained by the
finder or some institution; while the other part
is cut into small pieces, an inch or two on a side
and a quarter of an inch thick, but each large
enough to show the characteristic pattern.
These are distributed largely by sale to other
collectors. Thus a great meteorite collection
consists of a few large meteorites and a great
many small portions of other meteorites.</p>
<p>The second type of meteorite is the stony
meteorite. Where meteorites have been located
as they fell and recovered, the majority of them
were of this type, so that probably more than half
of the meteorites which fall are of the stony type.
However when the stony meteorite is exposed to
weathering it takes only a very short time before
the surface is eroded off and then such a meteorite
looks like any other boulder and probably
most of them fail to be recognized, and so have
been lost. Because they have so much greater
variety, they are in many ways of greater interest
than the iron type.</p>
<p>It is desirable that every one have his eye out
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
for meteorites, and when found it is desirable that
the fact should be reported to some one of the
great institutions which collect them, such as
the National Museum in Washington, or the
American Museum in New York. Each one
should be on record even if it is desired to keep
it in a private collection.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Fossils</span></h3>
<p>In the sedimentary rocks one is apt to find
remains of some of the animals and plants that
lived at the time the rock was forming. While
the soft parts of animals decompose rapidly,
shells and bones are likely to be buried in the
sediments, and if the conditions have been
favorable, these remains may be preserved more
or less perfectly. All through the millions of
years that sedimentary rocks have been forming
in the sea, in lakes, on river flood plains and in
wind swept deserts, there was an abundance of
life, as much as there is today; and our knowledge
of that life is derived from these buried
fossil remains, so that fossils have a great historic
interest.</p>
<p>However as there have lived and died several
times as many different kinds of animals as live
today, the study of fossils becomes a separate
subject, which cannot be treated in this book.
Should any collector of rocks and minerals come
upon fossils, he is opening a new field, and it will
be necessary to turn to other sources for their
identification. General books on this subject
are scarce, but one or two are given in the
literature list.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
